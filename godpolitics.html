            <p ><strong>Something new is taking place in the Church. The revelation of who we are supposed to be is getting clearer. The insights of the Prophets are being demonstrated by the Apsotles. The Teachers are building on the Foundation that the Apostles and Prophets have put down. Pastors are not just feeding sheep but building them up into Disciples. And, Evangelists are bringing people to Christ and not themselves! Praise God for what is taking placing in the Church. After so much disarray we are moving into Restoration.</strong></p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s look at something that is rarely understood and see if we can start to bring it into reality in our lives. We are called to be like Jesus and He was a &ldquo;Priest after the Order of Melchizedek&rdquo;. What does that mean for you? Let&rsquo;s see;</p>
            <p><strong>Psalms 110:1-4</strong> says: The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, <em>until</em> <strong>I make thine enemies thy footstool</strong>. The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. <strong>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power</strong>, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. The LORD hath sworn,and will not repent, Thou art a <strong>priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek</strong>.</p>
            <p>Hebrews chapter 7 begins to tell us about Melchizedec. He was the <em>King</em> of Salem and he was also <em>Priest</em> of the most high God. This is the one that Abraham tithed to.</p>
            <p>The written word to the Hebrews tell us that Jesus instituted a <em>New Order</em> of Priesthood. In the Old Testament there was the Order of Aaron but now we have <strong>the Order of Melchizedek</strong>. What is the difference and why was it necessary to change the Order of the Priesthood. A large part of the reason for the change is that Melchizedek was both a King and a Priest. In the Old Testament there was one king and many priests. In the Book for Revelation we see something new:</p>
            <p><strong>Revelation 5:9-10</strong> says: And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; <strong>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.</strong></p>
            <p>Christ has instituted a New Order of Priesthood of which he is the High Priest and we are called to become Priests. All of those who served God at the Tabernacle were of the family of Levi and all of the Priests were of one branch of that family; that of Aaron, Moses brother. So we see one family chosen to serve God as High Priest, Priests and Levites. But, Aaron was not a King he could not rule on the Earth. Jesus is the King of Kings which tells us that He is the Father of all who fulfill Hebrews 7:1-2 and Revelation 5:9-10 those who are called to be Kings and Priests after the Order of Melchizedek. The Old Testament foreshadows the New Testament. Christ is calling every believer into a position of both Authority as Kings and Service as Priests. This is not an automatic thing however. <em>Remember, Many are called; few are chosen</em>.</p>
            <p><em><strong>Here is the meat of what this call is really all about Revelation 5:10b</strong> And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: <strong>and we shall reign on the earth</strong>. This is why Jesus changed the Order... he wants us to be both Kings and Priests so we can Worship and Reign!</em></p>
            <p><strong>The Restoration of All Things</strong></p>
            <p>In Acts 3:21 the Word says that Jesus is going to <strong>REMAIN IN HEAVEN UNTIL <em>the times of restoration of all things</em>.</strong></p>
            <p>The Fivefold Ministry and the Gifts of the Spirit have been restored to the Church and the Fruit of the Spirit is now being cherished as paramount in every believers life. The Church is now moving into the final Restoration.</p>
            <p>A major part of the Restoration of all things is that Jesus enemies <em>become His footstool</em>. How will the enemies of Jesus become His footstool? Those who begin to walk in the Dominion of a King and with Kingly Authority will place them there!</p>
            <p>In this prelude to the <em>Days of Dominion</em> that the Church is to walk in we have seen the Priesthood of the Believer restored and the Presence of God has been restored to the Church. We now Worship with Spirit filled songs and we see the Dance with Flags and Banners restored. The Church is starting to be: awesome as an army with banners.</p>
            <p><strong><em>What&rsquo;s next?</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>The Genesis Mandate must be fulfilled!</em></strong></p>
            <p>Believers must be brought into Kingship so we can begin to reign on the earth and place Jesus&rsquo; enemies under His feet.</p>
            <p>Genesis 1:28 says: And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: <em>and have dominion</em> over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.</p>
            <p>It is only through <strong><em>&ldquo;Servant Leadership&rdquo;</em></strong> that Believers will ever do the <em><strong>&ldquo;exploits&rdquo;</strong></em> that the Prophet Daniel spoke of. Only after we become true Priests who are &ldquo;meek and humble&rdquo; as Christ was can we begin to yield the Authority of Kings!</p>
            <p>Let every Believer begin to see more than getting more stuff! We are called to the highest calling there is! We are to press into this calling. We are to let go  of everything so we can apprehend this calling that Christ has called us to!</p>
            <p>True Priesthood is that which goes behind the veil and comes out with a Kingly Strategy to exercise Dominion in the world.</p>
            <p>Any priesthood that does not do that is only mystical! God is not looking for mystics he is looking for Priests!</p>
            <p>Kings have power over territories, regions, cities, people groups. Kings have money, riches, power, armies.</p>
            <p>Do you want to walk in the full restoration of all things and become Kings and Priests?</p>
            <p><em><strong>Listen to what the Spirit is saying to the Church</strong></em></p>
            <p><strong><em>The same voice that called out to the Church saying Come and worship Me is now calling out Come War with Me!</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>The same voice that cried out Come into my Secret Chambers is now crying out Come onto my Battle Field.</em></strong></p>
            <p>I encourage you to print this revelation out and read it every day for a week.</p>
            <p>Start to dwell on The Genesis Mandate to have Dominion in all the Earth. Start to ask the Lord to bring you into the fullness of your Priesthood and then, as you become more and more of a Servant seek Him for the Transfer of Authority that He has in store for you!</p>
            <p>God Bless You!</p>
