      <p class="articlecredits" >UPDATE: MAY 14,  2011 - Thousands belonging to the immediate and spiritual family of David Wilkerson celebrated his life, legacy, and love for Christ at a memorial service Saturday, at Times Square Church in New York City.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">Speakers, including leadership of the church Wilkerson had founded and his relatives, honored the evangelical pastor for a life &ldquo;well-lived&rdquo; through personal testimonies and songs rejoicing that he is now in heaven.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">&ldquo;It was all about Jesus Christ,&rdquo; Carter Conlon, senior pastor of Times Square Church, said of Wilkerson&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;Everything that Wilkerson did, lived, believed and preached centered around the cross of Jesus Christ, the forgiveness of sins, and the wonderful and full, abundant life that God promises to those who would turn to Christ with an honest heart.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">Greg Wilkerson thanked supporters for praying for his family following the news of his father&rsquo;s passing and his mother&rsquo;s hospitalization. &ldquo;She will be in the hospital a couple more days. She&rsquo;s getting stronger,&rdquo; reported Greg Wilkerson.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">&ldquo;David was single-minded for Christ; a man of vision, courage and faith. His life, his preaching and his writings impacted millions. He was greatly loved and will be greatly missed.&rdquo; Don Wilkerson, President of Brooklyn Teen Challenge.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">Pastor Don Wilkerson said his brother, eight years his senior, was a &ldquo;father figure&rdquo; to him after their own father passed away. He recalled the life-changing experience of being called by the late Wilkerson to serve at Times Square Church. He also recounted an epic statement made by his older brother following a dispute that arose over the Times Square Church location. In asking why David Wilkerson chose this particular theater as the site for the church, the theater company suggested the reasoning probably laid behind the theater&rsquo;s large stage and reputation for having had many stars performed on it&rsquo;s stage. To which Wilkerson responded, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only going to be one star on my stage and that&rsquo;s the bright and morning star!&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">&ldquo;There is something deep in my heart that says, &lsquo;Come what may&rsquo; That the devil can&rsquo;t kill me, kill you, without God&rsquo;s permission. But if God permits it, instant glory! Instant Glory!&rdquo; the Rev. Wilkerson once stated in an old clip of the preacher speaking from the Times Square pulpit and declaring his bold confidence in God, even in the face of death.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">&ldquo;A resounding part of Pastor David&rsquo;s message was simply this: what God has done through me, he can do through you; If you will open your heart and let Jesus be Jesus in you; if you will simply read the scriptures and do what God says to do.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Back in 1958, rural Pennsylvania Pastor David Wilkerson was stirred by a Life magazine photo of teenage street thugs &ndash; and felt compelled by the Holy Spirit to go talk to the young gangsters.</p>
      <p>However, he found himself on the dark, dangerous streets of one of Brooklyn&rsquo;s worst housing projects, facing off with a laughing teenage &ldquo;warlord&rdquo; who flashed a switchblade, expecting the country preacher to retreat in fright.</p>
      <p>Instead, Wilkerson told Nicky Cruz &quot;You could cut me in a thousand pieces and lay them out in the street and every piece would love you.&quot; Nicky&rsquo;s life was never again the same.</p>
      <p>Today Cruz is an author and evangelist based in Colorado Springs who spearheads outreaches to street kids. He regularly speaks in crusades worldwide &ndash; often with Wilkerson&rsquo;s son, Gary.</p>
      <p>Of Dave&rsquo;s sudden death, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like somebody who was not only my spiritual father, but much more than that is gone,&rdquo; says Cruz.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt badly that I wasn&rsquo;t closer to my own father,&rdquo; he says. His dad was an occult healer in rural Las Piedras, Puerto Rico, who put Nicky on a plane to New York when he was just a boy, shipping him off to relatives, rather than try to deal with the adolescent&rsquo;s rebellion.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Dave became my spiritual father and was like my earthly father, too,&rdquo; remembers Cruz. &ldquo;He advised me about little things as well as big ones. He loved my kids. A year ago, we all got together. As he looked around at my children and my grandchildren, his eyes just lighted up. He was so proud of all of them.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Dave was a generous, giving person. You know, he was like the angel who stirred the pool in John, chapter 5. He stirred and gave. He started Teen Challenge, then gave it away.&rdquo; Teen Challenge today is a worldwide network of Christian rehabilitation centers.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;He got World Challenge going down in Texas,&rdquo; recalls Nicky, &ldquo;and gave it all away, too, to those who would carry on the work. Then he founded Times Square Church and gave it away when it was time.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Wilkerson&rsquo;s death shook him, says Nicky. &ldquo;It hurts. It hurts really bad. I miss him. I know I will see him again. I will spend eternity with him. &ldquo;But I will be there because he was bold enough in the power of the Holy Spirit to tell a kid holding a switchblade in his face that Jesus loved me. &ldquo;I have lost somebody who changed my life forever.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&quot;New York in that time was bombarded by gangs, and we were the prime leaders of the gangs,&quot; Cruz said. &quot;Even Frankenstein and Dracula were afraid to walk in that neighborhood. And he's a skinny preacher! Came from nowhere. There's no way that a type of guy like this can be so strong to stand [on] his own and to really really really take it.&quot;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to say goodbye to my spiritual father,&rdquo; Cruz said, adding that he never met his own father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told people for years that if it weren&rsquo;t for David Wilkerson, I&rsquo;d be in the pit of hell today.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Today Cruz attends The Springs Church in Colorado Springs, Colo., led by Gary Wilkerson, one of David&rsquo;s two sons born nearly the same day as when Cruz was born again. Cruz concluded his eulogy by saying: &ldquo;The world lost a true man of God.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Wilkerson&rsquo;s younger brother, Don, who ran Teen Challenge for many years, talked about how his famous brother felt called to go to New York City after reading an article in Life magazine about some gang members on trial for murder&mdash;and how he created a media sensation when he showed up at the trial. Don said people ask him how he got his own call to go to New York: &ldquo;It was on the phone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;David called me and asked me to come to New York to help him.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>David Wilkerson was a pioneer. He was the founder of Teen Challenge and I partnered with him in that. We were both founders of Times Square Church, and he was a strong preacher. He had what we call a prophetic ministry, relating events in the world to the Bible. A preacher of righteousness.</p>
      <p>David gained the attention of the entire nation and my brother&rsquo;s attention. His initial mission was just to go to New York and talk to the five young men who were on trial. And he didn&rsquo;t get a chance to do that. He went to court and asked the judge if he could say something and the judge threw him out of court. His picture went into the paper as the Bible preacher who interrupted the gang trial. He left the city embarrassed.</p>
      <p>But it was our grandfather who said to David when he was trying to sort out what went wrong and up in his face, &ldquo;David, you thought your mission was to talk to those boys. Maybe your mission is to help boys like that. Why don&rsquo;t you go back to the city?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>So he went back to the city, walked the area where the gang murder had taken place, and some gang members recognized him from the newspaper. And the comment that I will never forget, I&rsquo;ll never forget, is one of them said to my brother, &ldquo;Hey preacher, looks like the cops don&rsquo;t like you either. Must be on our side.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>So overnight, what could have taken months or years, he gained credibility with the gang overnight. When that gang member said, &ldquo;You must be on our side,&rdquo; I would say that is a redemptive analogy of Je&shy;sus coming down and took on human forms to be on our side.</p>
      <p>The gangs perceived him to be their advocate from there. That was almost an overnight open door to the gangs.</p>
      <p>So one weekend when I went home from college to Scranton (Pennsylvania), my sister and brother-in-law asked if I wanted to go to New York to see our brother who is preaching to gangs. So I happened to be there the night of the most celebrated convert of Teen Challenge, Nicky Cruz, ex-president of Mau Mau.</p>
      <p>So I was there the night the whole gang went forward for prayer and asked David to pray for them. So that was my taste. I had no idea at the time that that was my preview of my future. Because we both felt that we were called to be pastors, but the only difference is that we both still became pastors but our congregation changed (laughs). They happen to be all gang members and drug addicts. So that was the story.</p>
      <p>Wilkerson&rsquo;s son, Gary, said Wilkerson predicted the week before his death that his wife Gwen would probably outlive him. Diagnosed with cancer several times over the years, Gwen not only survived those instances, but was also in the car accident with Wilkerson. She is currently in the hospital and did not attend the funeral, but is expected to recover.</p>
      <p>Wilkerson founded Times Square Church in 1986 when he walked down 42nd street at midnight and his heart was broken over the prostitutes, pimps, runaways, drug addicts, hustlers, and X-rated movie houses he saw.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I saw 9-,10- and 11-year-old kids bombed on crack cocaine. I walked down 42nd Street and they were selling crack. Len Bias, the famous basketball player, had just died of a crack overdose, and the pusher was yelling, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve got the stuff that killed Len,&rsquo;&rdquo; recalled Wilkerson, according to the Times Square Church website.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I wept and prayed, &lsquo;God, you&rsquo;ve got to raise up a testimony in this hellish place&hellip; The answer was not what I wanted to hear: &lsquo;Well, you know the city. You&rsquo;ve been here. You do it.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>In October 1987, Wilkerson opened Times Square Church in Town Hall. The church was later moved to its present location, the Mark Hellinger Theater.</p>
      <p>David would have been 80 years old next month. He was retired and lived in Texas. His wife is in the hospital. She is in stable condition and she&rsquo;ll be released soon.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits"><strong>David Wilkerson is survived by his wife, Gwendolyn, four children and 11 grandchildren and brothers Don Wilkerson and Jerry Wilkerson and sister Ruth Harris.</strong></p>
