            <h4 class="qa">              Draws Tens of Thousands to NYC's Central Park</h4>
              <div id="authorname"></div>
              
              <p>Thousands  of people flocked to New York City's iconic Central Park on Saturday, to sway  to the sweet sounds of Matt Redman and Mandisa and to have their hearts pricked  by the preaching of Argentinian evangelist Luis Palau.</p>
              <img style="display:block; padding-top:20px;" src="images/luis-palau-god-in-the-city.jpg" title="New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio stands oon stage with several local pastors and evangelist Luis Palau at the Great Lawn at Central Park on July11, 2015 in New York City." alt="New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio stands oon stage with several local pastors and evangelist Luis Palau at the Great Lawn at Central Park on July11, 2015 in New York City." width="475" height="153">
              <p> They stood for hours in defiance of the  burdensome heat, leaned against gray metal railings and lay sprawl&shy;ed out on  towels on the brilliant green grass. Some watched from yards away, eyeing the  giant screens above and on either side of the stage while amplifiers carried  melodies from Heze&shy;kiah Walker, Marcos Witt  and Chris Tomlin through the air.</p>
              <img style="display:block; padding-top:20px;" src="images/luis-palau-god-in-the-city2.jpg" title="Recording artist Matt Redman and evangelist Luis Palau appear on stage on the Great Lawn at Central Park on July 11, 2015, in New York City." alt="Recording artist Matt Redman and evangelist Luis Palau appear on stage on the Great Lawn at Central Park on July 11, 2015, in New York City." width="475" height="153">
              <p> Others got as close as they could to the  stage. Although it was closest to the stage that the sun seemed most brazen and  should have been causing the most misery, the people there looked more elated  than annoyed-apparently too caught up with the music or the messages for  something as trivial as the sun to bother them.</p>
              <p> According to Ingrid Aya&shy;la, a volunteer  who offered to pray with attendees after Pa&shy;lau preached his message, she  noticed, &quot;A lot of people were touched. I saw a lot of people crying in  the front.&quot;</p>
              <p> But before they cried, they danced and  leaped in the air, raising their hands and voices while singing along with  Israel Hougton's &quot;You Are Good,&quot; and other popular contemporary  Christian and gospel songs.</p>
              <p> They came from the Bronx and Brooklyn,  Long Island and New Jersey, and there was a couple that even flew in from  Panama to volunteer as spiritual counse&shy;lors for  NY CityFest, the name of the gathering on Central Park's Great Lawn on  Saturday. The unusual event was organized in celebration of what 1,700 local  churches have been doing over the last year to help meet the needs of their  communities through service projects and school partnerships.</p>
              <p> The Central Park City&shy;Fest, the last of  three such major gatherings was headlined by Palau, dubbed by some as the  &quot;Latino Billy Graham,&quot; and featured remarks by former Yankees pitcher Maria&shy;no Rivera, whose  wife pastors a church in New Ro&shy;chelle. Other musical guests included Argentinian rock band Rescate and  TobyMac.</p>
              <p> NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio also appeared  on stage, where he was prayed for by Palau and several local pastors who  oversee the CityServe &quot;movement,&quot; as orga- nizers prefer to call the  $10 million-budgeted, three-year campaign. The 4pm-10pm. Central Park event,  like the ones at Radio City Music Hall and at Times Square, was free and open  to the general public.</p>
              <p> Several local pastors and evangelist  Luis Palau lay hands on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as they pray for him  on stage at the Great Lawn at Central Park on July 11, 2015, in NYC.</p>
              <p> Joseph Ramos, who drove with a group of  about 10 people from Upstate New York to Manhattan, said he was there to  &quot;hear God's praise &amp; worship with God's people and listen to the  speakers.&quot;</p>
              <p> Ramos noted what ma&shy;ny who spoke with The Christian Post also  pointed out when he added, &quot;It's just wonderful when God's people can all  come together from all different nations and backgrounds.&quot;</p>
              <p> Patrick and Dale Dowd were two among the  dozens spotted among the crowd that elected to speak and pray with a counselor  after Palau preached his message. Mrs.  Dowd, who is &quot;very involved&quot; with her Long Island church and attends  services weekly, said she simply felt moved by the message.</p>
              <p> &quot;I've never been to anything like  this, and it was just very moving,&quot; she said. Mr. Dowd said he felt  &quot;almost exactly the same.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;It's probably one of the most  amazing experiences, just because of the time  we're living in. Most people don't want  to speak out about being a Christian. You know, it's not the in thing to  do. So to come to a place like this to see people of all ages and just such  diverse backgrounds is a blessing,&quot; Mrs. Dowd added.</p>
              <p> &quot;One of the reasons that we came is  that we were sinners before,&quot; she told CP. &quot;We didn't know the Lord.</p>
              <p> Organizers had  been expecting a capacity crowd of 60,000 on the Great  Lawn, and although figures were not available by press time, it certainly  appeared that the turnout might have come close to expectations. But Palau, who has preached to millions  around the world, insisted that had there not been capacity restrictions for  the 55-acre lawn, at least five times as many people would have shown up.</p>
              <p> &quot;If we had a free place, there  could have been 300,000, 400,000 people easily. But still, who doesn't rejoice  to see a crowd like this, cheering the Lord, worshipping and standing for so  many hours. But the Holy Spirit is at work in  New York... There's a great hun&shy;ger in New York. There is spiritual  hunger,&quot; Palau told The Christian Post about an hour before taking to the  stage to deliver his message to the masses.</p>
              <p> Cynthia Moncion, who lives in Queens,  sat by herself on the green grass, sha&shy;ded under a short-brimmed hat and  sunglasses.</p>
              <p> &quot;A friend invited me to come and  just check out Luis Palau,&quot; she said. &quot;I really like his words. I  went to one of his events two weeks ago. It was a breakfast for women, and he  really inspired me to come today. So I'm here for him.&quot;</p>
              <p> Palau, 80, said he star&shy;ted dreaming  about preaching in New York City after his mentor, the Rev. Billy Graham, held  a record 16-week crusade at the old Madison Square Garden in 1957. A friend who  was volunteering with the crusade sent him every few days bulletins prin&shy;ted by Graham's ministry that informed  readers &quot;about all the conversions.&quot; It was during that time that  Palau decided, &quot;One day I'm gonna preach in New York.&quot;</p>
              <p> The venerable evangelist, popular among  New York City's Latino evangelical community, compared the Big Apple to Buenos  Aires (the capital of his home country).  He called them both big cities that like to pretend they are very  &quot;self-sufficient,&quot; although, he added, the 9-11 attacks in NYC might  have tempered that attitude.</p>
              <p> Palau shared what he had learned by  living in New York City for the past two months or so and visiting with local  Christians over the past year, ahead of his big event at Central Park&mdash; where  only Graham and Pope John Paul II have held worship services.</p>
              <p> &quot;Some, the minority churches, the  Latinos particularly, but others also, have always felt a little isolated. I  think now they feel more integrated, properly so,&quot; Palau said. &quot;I  think there's going to be in the future more working together. I hope the  Latinos, senior people who have authority over congregations or denominations, that  they will see that this is an opportunity to lead the Body of Christ, the  Church, forward.&quot;</p>
              <p> The evangelist was selective with his  words when he commented on &quot;those who kinda sat on the sidelines because  they were too busy&quot; to participate in NY CityServe-CityFest.</p>
              <p> &quot;Some that I thought have a reputation in town, but have not involved themselves I think have  forfeited the authority over some...many, many currents of the evangelical movement and they've forfeited their  authority and they'll never recuperate it,&quot; Palau warned without stating  any specific names.</p>
              <p> &quot;I think the leadership of the  evangelical movement of New York is gonna change hands. It was in hands that  refused to use the authority that God gave them,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> Either way, Palau said that once he and  his family return home to Portland, Oregon,  he hopes that the 1,700 partner churches will &quot;keep doing more of the  same, multiplying the unity.&quot;</p>
              <p> &quot;This will now go on, God willing,  for many years. The cooperation is growing among churches, the number of  churches I think is growing,&quot; he added.</p>
              <p> When Palau finally did take to the  stage, he preach&shy;ed about Jesus coming to heal the brokenhearted and &quot;to  save that which was lost.&quot; He also spoke directly to the children present,  telling them that Jesus wants them in his kingdom, too. And he spoke to the  poor, telling them of the riches of God's kingdom and that God loves (them)  &quot;with an everlasting love.&quot;</p>
              <p> Before  delivering his sermon, however Palau pray&shy;ed for the nation and  its leaders.</p>
              <p> &quot;O God  our Father, thank You for this nation where You have placed us.  Thank you, O God that You said happy, blessed, to be envied is the nation that fears God. O God, we pray that our nation  may fear You reverently, that the leaders  would be blessed and even of their will that they would do Your will on  Earth,&quot; Palau prayed in part, before he and the thousands congregated on  the lawn gave a hearty, &quot;Amen!&quot;</p>
