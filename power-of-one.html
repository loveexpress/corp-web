            <h4>Power Of One 3rd Annual Unity Day Festival</h4>
              <div id="authorname"><!--SECTION LEFT END-->
 </div>
              <p>The Power  of 1 Unity Day Festival was crea&shy;ted to unite the community, church and city  through corporate prayer, music, activities, vendors who provide delicious food  from varied nationalities, merchandise of all types and valuable information  from lo&shy;cal and national brand corporations. The goal is to entertain, educate  and enhance the quality of life within the  community.</p>
              <p>In 2012 after a bullet came through the  window of Good Samaritan Church, which at that time was loca&shy;ted on Avon Avenue  in New&shy;ark, NJ; the pastor gave Marvin Cratch a challenge to do something to  change the community.God gave Marvin a vision to shut down the vio&shy;lence on  Avon Avenue just for one day and within 40 days the vision came into fruition  with the help of New&shy;ark Council President, Mildred C. Crump, then Council- woman-At-Large, Mayor Ras Baraka, then  Newark South Ward Councilman and their teams,  Good Samaritan Church and the participation of ten local pastors and  their congregations. On that day men and women of God, community activist and  city officials spoke and inspired the crowd and over 4,000 people attended. We  had music and performers; more than 50 vendors provided food, merchandise and  services; and the setup and cleanup crew was second to none. Unity Day was a  big success with no rain, incident or confusion.</p>
              <p>Our second festival, which was held on  Saturday, September 28, 2013 with the theme &quot;Healing the Land&quot; from 2  Chronicles 7:14 was what this festival's main  focus was all about. That year Marvin met Adrianne Wilson and formed the  company &ldquo;The Power Of One 3C Foundation.&rdquo; We created a website and was able to  have our headquarters at St. John&rsquo;s Lutheran Church under the leadership of  Rev. Dr. Appolles Sweatte located at 333 Avon Ave. As with the previous year,  we closed Avon Avenue from Treacy Avenue to 14th Street - 8am to 8pm.&nbsp; But at 9am the Shofar was blown, everything  stopped and we all began to pray. On the main stage sin&shy;gers, dancers,  ministers and political leaders filled the airwaves with words of truth, encouragement  and worship to God.&nbsp; Healing took place  with a God-inspired phenomenon as pastors and ministers of over 10 denominations gathered around a 10 foot wooden  cross presented by the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal; and with a hammer and  a nail every one of them nailed their difference to the cross, as a gesture of  unification with a song of praise and fervent prayer. God did it once again and  it is marvelous in our eyes!&nbsp; </p>
              <p>This is the year  5774 in the Hebrew calendar - the year of &ldquo;Open Doors&rdquo;.&nbsp; Our 3rd year, and we have seen the mighty  hand of God move in miraculous ways. The  councilman of the Southward is now the Mayor of Newark and with this  being one of his first major events as mayor, plans are underway to make this  the largest and productive citywide event of its kind in Newark&rsquo;s history. Thus, we have added plans to attempt  to set a Guinness World Record for the Largest Praise Dance and are asking  everyone to sign up on our site <u>www.the powerof1unityday.org</u>, wear your church colors and name with TShirts that  we can provide. We also plan to facilitate group counseling sessions at our headquarters. As with the two  previous years, activities and attractions include; a Main Stage with various  Christian artist, such as soloist, groups &amp; choirs, spoken word, and rap &ndash;  prolific &amp; inspirational speakers. A Kidz Zone, Health &amp; Wellness  Pavilion, Food Court, Horseback Rides, Communi&shy;ty Choir and an awesome Praise  Dance Ministry.</p>
              <p>Our goal this year is to raise enough  capital to open the &ldquo;Amiri Baraka Outreach Center&rdquo; This facility will provide -  Jobs &amp; Training, Transitional Housing, Food Dis- tribution and Counseling &ndash;  To Decrease Crime, Restore Hope, &amp; Transform Newark. Some ask, why we chose  this name well as a Critic, Scholar, Civil Rights Activist, and Poet, we  believe that God used Amiri Baraka to bring positive change and that is the mission of the Outreach Center.</p>
              <p>An event of this magnitude takes a lot  of time, mo&shy;ney, and volunteers. There- fore,  we are asking everyone to be a part of this God-Inspired event by going to our  website <u>www.thepowerof1 unityday.org</u>; finding out what God wants you to do and  then sign-up or donate! </p>
              <p>The Power Of One 3C Foundation was  created to establish a relationship between the Church, Community and City; To  develop a platform were parishioners and neighbors can volunteer time and  donate money toward projects that will assist in the redevelopment of their  local community; and to promote fellowship  among the local churches to become one body. </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Corporate Prayer</strong> <strong>and Evangelism</strong></p>
              <p>Prayer will be offered up to God three  times during the day (9am,12pm, 3pm). Pastors, preachers &amp; Evangelists from  around the city will be asked to pray for a specific need for the people and  the city of Newark.</p>

              <p align="center"><strong>Community Choir</strong></p>
              <p>Besides  Corporate Pra&shy;yer, there is no better way that we can think of to  unite and worship God together than through a Community Choir.

              <p align="center"><strong>Praise Dance</strong></p>
