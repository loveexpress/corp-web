              <p><strong>Rev. Dr. Renee Fran&shy;ces Washington Gardner</strong> is a  woman of many firsts. When Har&shy;lem&rsquo;s renowned <strong>Bishop Preston</strong> <strong>Washington</strong>, <strong>Sr. </strong>passed  away, she became not only the first woman elected Pastor of an historic Baptist  Church in Harlem but the first wife to  succeed her husband and <strong>Memorial Bap</strong><strong>tist  Church&rsquo;s</strong> first female Senior Pastor.</p>
              <p>Fondly called Rev. Re&shy;nee by the  spiritual community of Harlem, she and her late husband Bishop Preston Washington, Sr. founded <strong>The </strong><strong>House of Hope</strong>,  a community revitalization project for homeless single parents and their  children. During the AIDS epidemic, Rev. Renee and Bishop Washington, Sr. were  on the frontline in the fight against the disease. Under their administration,  Memorial Baptist Church became one of the first Harlem-based churches to openly  address the issue from the pulpit. Their leadership and commitment was  instrumental in the formation of The Balm in Gilead, Inc. a leading  international non-governmental organization (NGO) that partners with houses of  worship to advocate and educate communities of color on HIV/AIDS. The couple  were pioneers during Har&shy;lem&rsquo;s expanding mega  church renaissance and served as ambassadors to Harlem Spi&shy;ritual Tours where they played an  instrumental role in nurturing the world-re&shy;nowned Japan Gospel Choir and  warmly welcome tourist from all over the world to receive a true worship  experience.</p>
              <p>In 2006, Rev. Dr. Renee married <strong>Rev. Dr. Sean P. Gardner, Sr.</strong>, Senior  Pastor of <strong>Eastward Missionary Baptist  Church</strong> and became Harlem&rsquo;s first Baptist preacher to serve as Senior Pastor  and First lady. Memorial Baptist Church and Eastward Missionary Church are  members of the United Missionary Baptist Association, a fellowship of over 100  Baptist churches in New York City, Bronx, and lower West&shy;chester, where Pastor Re&shy;nee serves as the  first women to be elected as the Second Vice Moderator.</p>
              <p>Continuing to operate in her own  gifting, Pastor Re&shy;nee formed The Memorial Baptist Church Women of Worship  Ministry. Over the years the ministry, which assists women in maturing spiritually, has grown to include a youth  and young adult wo&shy;men&rsquo;s ministry, which celebrated  their first retreat earlier this year. In the 10 years at the helm as  Senior Pastor, Pastor Renee instituted a finance committee, single&rsquo;s ministry,  senior&rsquo;s ministry, marriage ministry, missionary ministry, and mission /  evangelism ministry to name a few.</p>
              <p>Pastor Renee also took on the challenge  of renovating and modernizing Memorial Baptist Church. Under her administration  the historical edifice has a newly remodeled  sanctuary, fellowship hall, bathrooms and kitchen. It has a state of the  art sound system and new awning. Keeping up with the times, Rev. Renee also  initiated a website, established social media channels and created a monthly  newsletter called The Messenger.</p>
              <p>In August 2008, Pastor Renee held a  special ribbon cutting ceremony for the Rev. Dr. Preston R. Washington Sr.  Educational Wing. Her husband, Rev. Dr. Sean Gardner served as construction  site manager. The center, which will include an upcoming computer lab and  executive conference room, was developed for academic and career enrichment and  a resource center to build cultural awareness, civic pride and responsibility for all those who live in,  love and visit Harlem.</p>
              <p>A Brooklyn native, Pastor Renee Frances  Washington Gardner is a graduate of the NY Theological Semina&shy;ry/Eastern  Baptist Extension Program in Urban Ministry and is a respected cosmetologist  with extensive training in mortuary science. She received an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from St. Thomas Christian  College, is a current Chaplain for the NYC Transit Authority and is currently  enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Chaplaincy and Clinical Pastoral Education  Program. She is the recipient of numerous awards and citations including the  NAACP&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s History Month Award for Outstanding Community Service; the Woman of Excellence Award from the  Rev. Al Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network, and the Ringling Brothers and  Barnum Bailey Circus&rsquo; Community and Business  Leader Appreciation Award.</p>
              <p>Recognized as  an anoin&shy;ted preacher, counselor and spiritual leader, Pastor  Re&shy;nee was appointed to the Ordination Council  of the United Missionary Baptist Association.</p>
              <p>Pastor Renee has served in the gospel  ministry for over 28 years and is the mother of five sons and grandmother of  ten. She and Rev. Dr. Gardner, Sr. continue to share their love for the LORD  with other chur&shy;ches and houses of worship through leadership training,  workshops and symposiums throughout the nation.</p>
              <p><strong><em>In October 2014, Pastor Renee Frances  Washington Gardner will cele&shy;- brate  her 10th Anniversary of service to the Har&shy;lem and Greater New York  spiritual community as Senior Pastor of Memorial Baptist Church, 141 Bishop  Pres&shy;ton R. Washington Sr. Place (W.  115th St.), Harl&shy;em, NY 10026. For more information call  212-663-8830. </em></strong></p>
