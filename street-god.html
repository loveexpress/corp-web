              <p>The <strong>Love Express</strong> is so proud of the newest venture from Pastor Dimas  Salaberrios&ndash;his new book <em>Street God</em>. It chronicles his explosive  true life story of being a former drug boss, being radically transformed by the power of Jesus Christ, and then  going back to the streets to pull others out of it&rsquo;s grip. It just landed in  bookstores all over the country and is already extending its global reach by being translated into two languages&ndash;Dutch and  Finnish. Josh McDowell literally &quot;dares anyone to read <em>Street God</em> and come away unchanged,&quot; crowning it &quot;The Cross  and the Switchblade for a new ge&shy;neration.&quot;  Dr. Tim Keller adds, &quot;You won't find a more amazing  account of how God's grace can change lives,&quot; and Dr. A.R. Bernard calls it &ldquo;powerful.&rdquo; What a joy it is to see other  great leaders affirming the faith and trust we at the Love Express placed in Pastor Dimas years ago! &quot;My first  cover page was in the Love Express,&rdquo; Pastor Dimas shares, &ldquo;an extremely  important paper for the Tri-State region. I sincerely appreciate the  value this paper adds to the faith community  here. Its consistent reporting unites the Body of Christ together on a monthly  basis and should ne&shy;ver be taken for granted. Edith Stranges believed in me and  several of my colleagues who are all working tirelessly to make Christ known outside of their own  churches.&rdquo;</p>
              <p><em>Street  God</em> has already reached bestseller status, debuting on some of the top TV and radio programs in the nation like the  #1 cable news morning show <em>Fox &amp; Friends, TBN&rsquo;s </em>worldwide popular <em>Praise  The Lord </em>show and much more. Yet  far more impressive than sales perhaps is the phenomenal reach of Pastor Dimas&rsquo;s tome, often impacting those in forgotten  places.&nbsp; For the entire month of August,  Pastor Dimas struck a deal with his publi&shy;sher  Tyndale Momentum that for every book purchased on their StreetGod Book.com website, one would also be given to a  prisoner.&nbsp; The kingdom-mindedness of that  action alone speaks volumes about this new author. &ldquo;Inmates and their family members write  to me and Facebook me testimonies of how  the book <em>Street God</em> is going from  cell to cell assisting in converting hearts. Mothers are reading it weeping at  the hope it swells within their hearts as they then give the book to  their sons. Young men are giving their lives to Jesus in droves totally rocked  by the power of the blood of the Lamb and the word of this strong testimony. Churches are poring over it as  a blueprint on how to revamp their evangelistic efforts. I never imagined this book would become like a new Bible  tract. I am grateful that what I went through with all its many trials and triumphs is being a blessing to so many  lives,&rdquo; said Pastor Dimas.</p>
              <p><em>Street God</em> is an authentic New York story masterfully detailing the crack boom era  that impacted the entire city, and is a literary &ldquo;Boot Camp&rdquo; for anyone&rsquo;s  faith! The book offers an intimate case study of just how easily kids get  snatched into the drug underworld and how God miraculously dethroned Satan  from a young man&rsquo;s heart. Recalling some of the intense pain of his past, Pastor Dimas shared with us that he was  literally shaking at times while writing the book. A cursory glance at some of <em>Street God&rsquo;s</em> reviews on  Amazon makes clear that many readers are also riveted by this story as they  experience the same twists and turns as they read it. Also notable is  that the book doesn&rsquo;t just end at Pastor Dimas&rsquo;s transformation in Christ, but  also details his evolution to becoming one of the great leaders in this, the greatest  city on earth!&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Pastor  Dimas said, &quot;My hope is that this book empowers families to not give up on  their kids. I broke my mother&rsquo;s heart. My Mom was an ele&shy;men&shy;tary school  principal and my Dad was a former Air Force man and captain of corrections. I hailed from a family of educators and  professionals. Leaping from taking karate lessons in middle school to  becoming a kingpin drug dealer was never the trajectory my parent&rsquo;s planned for  me, yet something I willfully and stubbornly chose. One of the greatest  blessings in my life is that my mother left this world proud of my decision to  follow Jesus and impact other&rsquo;s lives across the world. I had the privilege of  serving her in my home as she passed before my eyes.&rdquo; </p>
              <p>Dimas was introduced to the drug world  at the tender age of 11 years old by a fellow classmate at a predo&shy;mi&shy;nately white middle school. Drawn to the  money-making images he&rsquo;d seen in the mo&shy;vie Scarface, Dimas soon threw himself  into drug dealing, and by age 15 and 16, he served 2 stints in the notorious  Rikers Island jail for drug trafficking charges.  At 17, he escaped police custody while  handcuffed, dres-sed up like a woman on  Halloween in order to evade the authorities and traveled all the way  down to Winston-Salem, NC where he finally achieved his goal of becoming a  &quot;street god,&quot; a drug kingpin who headed a thriving drug and  gun-dealing enterprise.&nbsp; But then he had  an encounter with 3 brave women that completely changed his life. They prayed  for him and he immediately changed his allegi&shy;ance from the violent, crazed  world he was in, to the peace that came with his spiritual conversion. Wanting to finally obey the laws  of the land even though he was facing at least 7 years in prison for escaping  police custody, he willingly traveled back to NYC, walked into a police station  and turned himself. The judge who oversaw his  case miraculously pardoned him, discerning that he was indeed a changed  man and sending him back to jail would only ruin him. </p>
              <p>In the 20 years since Dimas received his  pardon, he has traveled to every continent except Antarctica hoping to rescue  other people from the same entanglements with the underworld that he had experienced as a  teen&shy;ager. He started a church in the Bronx River Housing projects - the literal birthplace of hip hop, which is also located in the poorest  congressional district of the entire US. The week his church started, a  homicide had taken place in Bronx  River. But over the course of 10 years, Pastor Dimas and Infinity&rsquo;s powerful  impact was cited by former NYC Police Commissioner Ray Kelly with being  the primary reason homicides were eliminated  in Bronx River and drug dealing brought to an all-time low in that  community. <em>Street God</em> should be  required reading as a case study for parents and teens.&nbsp; The lessons  to be learned therein are life-changing.</p>
              <p><strong>Baltimore-Reaction to Judge Won&rsquo;t Drop  Charges Against Cops in the Freddie Gray Case</strong><em>.</em> The night of the riots in Baltimore, there  were over 200 arrests as the world watched in horror as yet another inner city was set ablaze. On Day 2, Pastor Dimas boldly went &ldquo;into the fire&rdquo; so  to speak, specifically targeting tough guys, gang members and those set on  defiantly ignoring the curfew that was to go into effect that night.  While hundreds of pastors that critical 2nd night were meeting, organizing and  praying indoors, Pastor Dimas and his team were on the ground, strategically redirecting the negative energy of those young men and causing them to think beyond just that  night.&nbsp; As you&rsquo;ll see, it definitely  wasn&rsquo;t all pretty, but proved to be remarkably  effective(side note ...after Dimas&rsquo;s on the ground approach, there were only 2  arrests that 2nd night). </p>
              <p>Pastor Dimas  will bring rich analysis to the very real frustrations police officers are  sensing nationwide in the wake of cop killings and hateful speech attributed to  the Black Lives Matters movement. Pastor Dimas has  personally experienced both good and corrupt cops. His work in the Bronx River  community working WITH law enforcement has been very effective  in that community.&nbsp; A video of cops  playing basketball with kids recently went viral - those were kids from Bronx  River who attend Pastor Dimas&rsquo;s church, Infinity Bible Church - see 2 NYPD Cops  Play Basketball With Neighborhood Kids.... &amp; KILL IT! He will do an  incredible job highlighting how vital relationship-building is to transforming  the angst between officers and community members.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Heroin Epidemic: The Crack  Boom in the Inner Cities in the 90s is the He&shy;ro&shy;in </em></strong><strong><em>EPIDEMIC in the Suburbs Today&hellip;a Timely Back to </em></strong><strong><em>School WARNING! </em></strong>Pastor Dimas will sound the alarm, &ldquo;Parents in America: WAKE UP&rdquo;! The image of the shady, older-looking drug dealer  lurking in alley shadows trying to lure young kids his way is GONE!&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s heroin dealers look just like  your kids and are specifically targeting middle schools, so that by high school, they have ready-made, full blown addicts. Remember, Dimas was only  11 when he took his first drug offered by none other than his classmate.  Heroin sells for just $2&ndash;$3 a hit!&nbsp; Kids  are using their lunch money to sniff it up, having been it will make them happy  and have fun. Dimas will highlight his past -  how if anyone should have escaped the drug world&ndash;a school principal&rsquo;s  and captain of corrections son living in the  suburbs of Queens, he definitely see-med like a prime candidate.&nbsp; He will offer both preventative tips he can  offer having experienced all sides of the drug world. His life sto&shy;ry is also a  beacon of hope for those parents and teens who have already been caught up in a  devastating downward spiral that is drug addiction. THIS is the back to school  message both teens and parents NEED to hear!</p>
              <p>DIMAS  SALABERRIOS has served as senior pastor of Infinity Bible Church, which he  founded in partnership with Dr. Tim Keller and Redeemer City to City since 2003. A former New York City police commissioner  credited Pastor Dimas and Infinity&rsquo;s powerful impact in the Bronx River  Housing projects as being the startling reason homicides have been eliminated  and drug dealing reduced to an all-time low in that community for over a  decade.</p>
              <p>Pastor Dimas is a gifted storyteller and  Bible teacher. As president of Concerts of Prayer Greater New York, he spearheads the largest, most diverse force of  pastors in a tri-state area comprised of over 5,000 churches mobilized across  various denominational, ethnic and economic lines.</p>
              <p>A true  servant-leader at heart, Pastor Dimas is often described as one unafraid of  running into the fire. With real &ldquo;boots on the ground&rdquo;, Pastor Dimas is often advancing the cause of Christ  during the nation&rsquo;s most pressing issues, as well as boldly proclaiming the  gospel on every continent (with the exception of Antarctica). Perhaps that explains his undeniable  effectiveness and relevance&mdash;be it quelling the riots that recently raged in  Baltimore or bringing hope and healing directly to those devastated by the  vicious slaughter of the Emanuel 9 in Charleston.&nbsp; Some of Pastor Dimas&rsquo;s global ministry  exploits include igniting a three-month revival in New Zealand; smuggling  Bibles to the persecuted church in China; pastoral leadership training and  humanitarian aid throughout Kenya; being a first-responder and lifeline to three  refugee camps after Haiti&rsquo;s devastating  earthquake; guerrilla evangelism in in Amsterdam&rsquo;s notorious red-light district, on the tubes of London, in the alps of Switzerland, in the hills  of Venezuela and with the gangs in the  South Bronx.</p>
              <p>A passionate  and exciting speaker, Pastor Dimas&rsquo;s humor and inspiring style has opened doors for him to appear on Fox &amp; Friends, TBN, the Word  Network, the 700 Club, CNN, Fox News, ABC World News To&shy;night, and NBC News as  well as being featured in the New York Times, The Washington Post, Christianity  Today, Outreach, On Faith and other publications. His  weekly TV pro- gram The Dynamic Life with Pastor Dimas can be seen on the Word  Network in over 80 million homes around the world, and his weekday radio show  is broadcast over the Salem Radio Network.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Pastor Dimas holds a Master  of Divinity degree from Alliance Theological Seminary and lives in the Bronx  with his wife, Tiffany, and their two daughters.</em></strong></p>
