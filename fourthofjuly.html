            <h4>Fourth Of July</h4>
            <h4 class="qa">Remembering America As Nation <br>
              Under God</h4>
            <div id="authorname"></div>
      <p >This year marks 236 years since our Founding Fathers gave us our National Birth Certificate. We continue to be the longest ongoing Constitutional Republic in the history of the world. Blessings such as these are not by chance or accidental. They are blessings of God.</p>
      <p>On July 2, 1776, Congress voted to approve a complete separation from Great Britain. Two days afterwards &ndash; July 4th&ndash; the early draft of the Declaration of Independence was signed, albeit by only two individuals at that time: John Hancock, President of Congress, and Charles Thompson, Secretary of Congress. Four days later, on July 8, members of Congress took that document and read it aloud from the steps of Independence Hall, proclaiming it to the city of Philadelphia, after which the Liberty Bell was rung. The inscription around the top of that bell, Leviticus 25:10, was most appropriate for the occasion: &ldquo;Proclaim liberty throughout the land and to all the inhabitants thereof.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>To see the turmoil in other nations, their struggles and multiple revolutions, and yet to see the stability and blessings that we have here in America, we may ask how has this been achieved? What was the basis of American Independence? John Adams said &ldquo;The general principles on which the Fathers achieved independence were the general principles of Christianity.&rdquo; Perhaps the clearest identification of the spirit of the American Revolution was given by John Adams in a letter to Abigail the day after Congress approved the Declaration. He wrote her two letters on that day; the first was short and concise, jubilant that the Declaration had been approved. The second was much longer and more pensive, giving serious consideration to what had been done that day. Adams cautiously noted: &ldquo;This day will be the most memorable epic in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>It is amazing that on the very day they approved the Declaration, Adams was already foreseeing that their actions would be celebrated by future generations. Adams contemplated whether it would be proper to hold such celebrations, but then concluded that the day should be commemorated &ndash; but in a particular manner and with a specific spirit. As he told Abigail: &ldquo;It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>John Adams believed that the Fourth of July should become a religious holiday &ndash; a day when we remembered God's hand in deliverance and a day of religious activities when we committed ourselves to Him in &ldquo;solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.&rdquo; Such was the spirit of the American Revolution as seen through the eyes of those who led it, evidenced even further in the words of John Quincy Adams, one who was deeply involved in the activities of the Revolution.</p>
      <p>In 1837, when he was 69 years old, he delivered a Fourth of July speech at Newburyport, Massachusetts. He began that address with a question: &ldquo;Why is it, friends and fellow citizens, that you are here assembled? Why is it that entering on the 62nd year of our national existence you have honored [me] with an invitation to address you. . . ?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The answer was easy: they had asked him to address them because he was old enough to remember what went on; they wanted an eyewitness to tell them of it! He next asked them: &ldquo;Why is it that, next to the birthday of the Savior of the world, your most joyous and most venerated festival returns on this day [the Fourth of July]?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>An interesting question: why is it that in America the Fourth of July and Christmas were our two top holidays? Note his answer: &ldquo;Is it not that, in the chain of human events, the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked with the birthday of the Savior? That it forms a leading event in the progress of the Gospel dispensation? Is it not that the Declaration of Independence first organized the social compact on the foundation of the Redeemer's mission upon earth? That it laid the cornerstone of human government upon the first precepts of Christianity?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>According to John Quincy Adams, Christmas and the Fourth of July were intrinsically connected. On the Fourth of July, the Founders simply took the precepts of Christ which came into the world through His birth (Christmas) and incorporated those principles into civil government.</p>
      <p>Another minister-leader in the Revolution was the Rev. James Caldwell. His actions during one battle inspired a painting showing him standing with a stack of hymn books in his arms while engaged in the midst of a fierce battle against the British outside a battered Presbyterian church. During the battle, the Americans had developed a serious problem: they had run out of wadding for their guns, which was just as serious as having no ammunition. Rev. Caldwell recognized the perfect solution; he ran inside the church and returned with a stack of Watts Hymnals&ndash;one of the strongest doctrinal hymnals of the Christian faith (Isaac Watts authored &ldquo;O God Our Help In Ages Past,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joy to the World,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus Shall Reign,&rdquo; and several other classic hymns). Distributing the Watts Hymnals among the soldiers served two purposes: first, its pages would provide the needed wadding; second, the use of the hymnal carried a symbolic message. Rev. Caldwell took that hymn book &ndash; the source of great doctrine and spiritual truth &ndash; raised it up in the air and shouted to the Americans, &ldquo;Give 'em Watts, boys!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The spiritual emphasis manifested so often by the Americans during the Revolution caused one Crown -appointed British governor to write to Great Britain complaining that: &ldquo;If you ask an American who is his master, he'll tell you he has none. And he has no governor but Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Letters like this, and sermons like those preached by the Rev. Peter Powers titled &ldquo;Jesus Christ the King,&rdquo; gave rise to a sentiment that has been described as a motto of the American Revolution. Most Americans are unaware that the Revolution might have had mottoes, but many wars do (e.g., in the Texas' war for independence, it was &ldquo;Remember the Alamo&rdquo;; in the Union side in the Civil War, it was &ldquo;In God We Trust&rdquo;; in World War I, it was &ldquo;Remember the Lusitania&rdquo;; in World War II, it was &ldquo;Remember Pearl Harbor&rdquo;; etc.). A motto of the American Revolution directed against the tyrant King George III and the theologically discredited doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings (which asserted that when the king spoke, it was the voice of God speaking directly to the people) was simple and direct: &ldquo;No King but King Jesus!&rdquo; Another motto (first suggested by Benjamin Franklin and often repeated during the Revolution) was similar in tone: &ldquo;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Preserving American liberty depends first upon our understanding the foundations on which this great country was built and then preserving the principles on which it was founded. Let's not let the purpose for which we were established be forgotten. The Founding Fathers have passed us a torch; let's not let it go out.</p>
