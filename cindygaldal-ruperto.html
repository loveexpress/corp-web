            <h4>Oasis Singles</h4>
            <p><span class="qa">Hundreds of Singles to Attend the  Annual Oasis Singles Valentine&rsquo;s Event</span></p>
            <div id="authorname">
            <p>by Cindy Galdal-Ruperto            </div>
              
              
              <p>When was  the last time you saw a film so riveting it kept you on the edge of your seat?  This year, at our <strong>ANNUAL OASIS SINGLES  VA&shy;LENTINE&rsquo;S EVENT</strong> coming up on <strong>Saturday,  February 15th </strong>at<strong> 6pm</strong> we will be showing just such a film. When I saw it I was struck by how profound  it was and by how it bought me closer to the  Lord. We are inviting singles not just to come and enjoy the film but to  bring unsaved friends and family with them so they can be drawn to the Lord.</p>
              <p>The biggest singles event of the year is  our <strong>VA&shy;LENTINE&rsquo;S EVENT. </strong>These events  always draw our lar&shy;gest crowds. Many singles of all ages from different  denominations and from all walks of life from throughout the tri-state area  attend each year. We host these Christ-centered events at <strong>The First Evangelical Free Church</strong> located at 6501 Sixth Avenue in  Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. We suggest that you arrive by 5:30pm because tickets  cannot be reserved ahead of time.</p>
              <p>This year the focus will not just be on  the God who is Author of Love but on how we can share His love with others. </p>
              <p>We will begin this very special evening  at 6pm with a meal. Singles are used to eating alone, so it is wonderful to be  able to enjoy a meal with fellowship. The dinner will feature a catered Italian  buffet. The delicious menu consists of two choices: Rigatoni with meat sauce,  salad and bread or Baked Ziti, salad and bread. A cozy caf&eacute; atmosphere with low  lighting and lots of greenery makes it the perfect place for making new  friends. You can come with friends or by yourself. Many singles come by  themselves and travel a long distance to do so. Friendly greeters will make you  feel right at home from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave.  Church singles groups are welcome.</p>
              <p>Our guest speaker will be <strong>Martin Aschner</strong> from <strong>Calvary Baptist Church</strong> in Manhattan. He  is committed to the love ethic of Jesus. As such he is enthusiastic about  sharing the Gospel with others. His presentation will include not just this  short film but also practical tips for reach&shy;ing out in love to anyone you  know. There will also be a time of interaction with other singles as we break  up in small groups to discuss the film.</p>
              <p>Fellowship and dessert will complete  this uplifting evening. There will be plenty of time to meet everyone who  attends this event. We have a special way of helping you do that! <strong><em>OASIS</em></strong> is a very friendly place. We will also be presenting a new game room for  everyone who wants to join in an activity as a group. This is a great way for  singles to make new friends in an informal, fun way. </p>
              <p>If you are tired of the singles scene, <strong><em>OASIS</em></strong> will be a refreshing change for you. There is no excuse to stay home. Come on  out! This Valentine&rsquo;s you&rsquo;ve got a date with hundreds of Christian singles who are living for God and enjoying  their inseparable union in Him. His eternal, unshakeable Love is worth  celebrating and sharing! </p>
              <p class="articlecredits"><strong><em>Admission is $15 at the door. Tickets cannot  be reserved ahead of time. Attire is casual, but neat. If you would like to  volunteer to help out as we set up &amp; decorate before the event call 718-836-0029 or e-mail  Cindy@CompleteinChrist. com. To volunteer the day of the event you need to arrive at 4 pm. Visit www.  CompleteinChrist.com for directions.</em></strong>          </p>
