              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Confessions</strong></p>
              <p>What are Confessions? Confessions are  proclamations of the Word of God. When we give voice to God&rsquo;s Word, we give the  written word power and authority in our lives.  When we speak the Word of God in faith, we unleash the power of the  angels to work on our behave to bring to pass the stated promises of God. Open  Your Mouths and Proclaim the Promises of God for Your Life!</p>
              <p>The following Confessions are from God&rsquo;s  Crea&shy;tive Power for Finances by Charles and Annette Capps.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Calling Things That Are Not To Increase Your  Paycheck</strong></p>
              <p>As an  employee, you act in faith by performing your job with the  highest integrity and diligence. Act as if you are a highly paid employee. If  possible, tithe in faith in advance for your raise or promotion. Hold your  paycheck or stub in your hand, and say:</p>
              <p><em>Heavenly  Father, I call for a raise as I honor You with the firstfruits of my increase.  I give thanks for this job and bless my employer. I now declare that this check  is multiplied and increased.&nbsp; I am now  richly rewarded for my work, both creatively and financially. (Prov. 3:9-10)</em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>To Increase Your Investments and Bank Accounts</strong></p>
              <p>Make a list of your investments and bank  accounts, or use bank state- ments. Place them in front of you and proclaim:</p>
              <p><em>I  call for abundance as I honor the Lord with my capital and sufficiency. My  storage places (investments and bank accounts) are filled with plenty, and my  presses burst forth with new wine daily. I am abundantly supplied. (Prov 3:9-10  AMP)</em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>For Employment</strong></p>
              <p><em>I&nbsp; now dissolve and put aside all negative, limiting beliefs about where I work and what  kind of job is available to me. I open myself to all of Gods&rsquo;s possibilities. I  call for a perfect, satisfying, well-paying job to manifest in my life. I am  always in the right place at the right time, for the Spirit of God directs my steps. (Prov.16:9; Rom. 5:17)</em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>To Eliminate Debt</strong></p>
              <p><em>In  Jesus&rsquo; name and on the authority of His holy  word, I call these <u>debts paid in full! </u>Debt, I speak to you in Jesus&rsquo; name: <u>Be paid</u> and <u>be gone!</u> Dematerialize and <u>cease to exist!</u> I now declare that all my debts,  mortgages, and notes are <u>paid in full</u>, <u>canceled</u>, or <u>dissolved!</u></em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>To Sell Property</strong></p>
              <p>Speak to the property and say:</p>
              <p><em>Listen  to me. I am talking to you. Jesus said you would obey me. You are go&shy;ing to be  a blessing to someone and I call you sold in Jesus&rsquo; name! </em></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Divine Protection</strong></p>
              <p>1. My prosperity causes me to be like a  mountain&ndash;an object that cannot be moved (Psalm 30:6-7; Psalm 112:6-8).</p>
              <p>2. The Lord has granted me long life and has  preserved me from destruction (Job 10:12).</p>
              <p>3. I declare that no matter what happens  around me, I have a covenant of peace, or wholeness, with God. His love,  kindness and protection will never depart from me (Isaiah 54:10, 14-17; 1  Samuel 25:6).</p>
              <p>4. No weapon formed  against me prospers, and every tongue that rises up in  judgment against me shall be proven wrong (Isaiah 54:17, AMP).</p>
              <p>5. In the name of Jesus, I dwell in the secret  place of the Most High God and abide under the shadow of the Almighty (Psalm  91:1).</p>
              <p>6. The Lord is my Refuge and Fortress. He  delivers me from the enemy; therefore, I do not fear the terror in the night or  the destruction that takes place at noonday (Psalm 91:2-6).</p>
              <p>7. When I call on the Lord, He immediately answers me. He is with me in  trouble; He always delivers me (Psalm 91:15-16).</p>
              <p>8. Because the Lord has gi&shy;ven His angels  charge over me, my life is redeemed from destruction. No evil comes near me,  and neither does any plague come near my home (Psalm 91:10-11).</p>
              <p>9. Although hard times may come, they pass me  by because I am established in righteousness (Isaiah 54:14-15).</p>
              <p>10. I declare that I fear no evil, because the  Holy Spirit comforts me (Psalm 23). He lives inside of me. Greater is He Who is  in me than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4)</p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Favor Confessions</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Concerning Family:</strong></p>
              <p>1. God&rsquo;s favor  causes my fa&shy;mily to increase more and more (Psalm 115:14).</p>
              <p>2. (For the Husband to say):</p>
              <p>a) My wife is blessed and highly favored among  wo&shy;men (Luke 1:28).</p>
              <p>b) She is a virtuous woman who prospers in  everything she does at home, work, in business and in other affairs (Proverbs  31:10-31).</p>
              <p>c) My relationship with my wife is good;  together we have obtained the favor of the Lord (Proverbs 18:22).</p>
              <p>3. (For the Wife to say):</p>
              <p>a) My husband is blessed and highly favored  among men because God is with him (Genesis 39:2; Luke 1:28).</p>
              <p>b) He sits in places of authority among other  leaders (Proverbs 31:23).</p>
              <p>4. My children are blessed and well favored of  God. They are skillful and wise, and they stand before kings (Daniel 1:4-5, 9).</p>
              <p>5. Like Jesus, my  children increase in wisdom, stature and favor with God and men  (Luke 2:52; 1 Samuel 2:26; 16:22).</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Healing</strong></p>
              <p>1. Thank You, Father, for sending Your Word to  deliver me from destruction (Psalm 107:20).</p>
              <p>2. Jesus bore my griefs (pains) and carried my  sorrows (sicknesses). He was pierced through for my transgressions and crushed  for my iniquities. The punishment for my well-being fell on Him, and by His  stripes I am healed (Isaiah 53:4-5; 1 Peter 2:24).</p>
              <p>3. Father, Your words are life to me. They are  healing and health to all my flesh (Proverbs 4:22, AMP).</p>
              <p>4. Since the Spirit of Him Who raised Christ  Jesus from the dead dwells in me, that same Spirit also gives life to my body  (Romans 8:11).</p>
              <p>5. Thank You, Father God, that I prosper and  am in health even as my soul prospers (3 John 2).</p>
              <p>6. Lord, You restore my health and heal my  wounds (Jeremiah 30:17).</p>
              <p>7. Thank You, Lord, for forgiving all of my  iniquities and healing all of my diseases (Psalm 103:3).</p>
              <p>8. Thank You, Father, that my light breaks  forth as the morning and that my health springs forth speedily (Isaiah 58:8).</p>
