            <h4 id="articleTitle">Pastor Carmine Saginario</h4>
            <div id="authorname"></div>
      <p ><strong>Carmine Saginario</strong> was born of immigrant parents in New York City on 16 March 1916. As a result of a miraculous healing of his mother, both parents surrendered their lives to the Lord. Carmine also became a believer at the age of 11 and not long after, at the age of 12, he began preaching. His definite call to the ministry came at 17 years of age and ordination followed in 1938.</p>
      <p>Carmine wore many hats during his life including pastor, assistant pastor, youth leader, evangelist, denominational leader, public school and Bible college teacher and mentor (assisting many to develop into ministers and Christian leaders). His first pastorate was in Brooklyn at the Church of the Redeemer. Other churches under his leadership included the Italian Church of God of Brooklyn and the Church of the Revelation in the Bronx. Some of the other positions he held are as follows: organizer and director of the youth movement of his denomination (the Christian Church of North America, now known as the International Fellowship of Christian Assemblies), administrator of that denominational periodical, Presbyter, General Secretary, Assistant Overseer, Vice-president, and finally General Overseer of that fellowship of churches. His teaching skills were utilized in Brooklyn, NY, and on Long Island, NY.</p>
      <p>What has been the legacy left by Pastor Saginario? Beginning with his own family, he is the son of a dedicated pastor and missionary, and the father and grandfather of pastors and ministers. He and his wife Lucy bore four children (one an executive of the phone company, the other a public school teacher), five grandchildren, and a host of great grandchildren. While raising a family, it was not uncommon for him to tirelessly travel to two churches on Sunday and during the week (he usually pastored two churches at a time), teach public school during the week, drive to Long Island to teach at a Bible School, and attend college classes.</p>
      <p>One of his pastorates (the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; church, The Italian Church of God of Brooklyn), mothered or planted a number of other churches in that boro. He was influential in the actual building of a church in the Bronx after the former one was consumed by flames from vandals. Carmine performed a countless number of marriages and baby dedications, laid to rest many deceased persons (including his own wife, daughter and infant son), and officiated at a host of ordinations and religious functions. It is not uncommon to still hear people say, &ldquo;He performed our wedding and dedicated our children. Now he is officiating at the wedding of our children that he dedicated.&rdquo; His influence in the New York City area has continued even after moving from that location to be with his ill daughter in Tennessee. The denomination he has been associated with over these many years owes so much to his skills and determination to see God move in a group of Christians. Whatever office he held, he did it for the glory of God and for the &ldquo;perfecting of the saints.&rdquo; &ldquo;Brother Carmine,&rdquo; as he is called, is considered a father to the movement and to the work of God both stateside and abroad (his position opened the way for international travel and ministry even up to a year or so ago).</p>
      <p>Pastor Saginario, at the present age of 95, still ministers to God&rsquo;s people wherever and whenever he can. Faithfully each Sunday one can hear him play his violin for church services. He recently spoke to a congregation in Rochester, NY. And at his grandson&rsquo;s congregation in Cleveland, OH, where he presently lives and attends church, he preached two services on Sunday morning. His limited travels do not keep him from reaching out to people in other ways too. Ask anyone who has received a greeting from him in the mail&hellip;, he blesses people daily by those encouraging cards that he sends out. His telephone conversations are challenges to young and old alike, and his prayers are sermons in themselves.</p>
      <p>Elderly folks are often asked, &ldquo;What is the secret for long life?&rdquo; Their answers include: exercise, or healthy diet, or some other natural causes. Carmine Saginario has reached this milestone in his life most likely because God is not finished using him to be the great influence that he has been to New York, the USA, and the world. &ldquo;Occupy until&hellip;&rdquo; should probably be his motto as well as the motto of all Christians.</p>
