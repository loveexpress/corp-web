      <p >A fire in East Farmingdale at a charity that gives out thousands of free meals is believed to be suspicious, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>The headquarters of the Hope For the Future ministries was badly damaged in the Sunday morning fire.</p>
      <p>The nondenominational Christian group, which gives away groceries and hot meals to the homeless and poor, is now at the center of an arson investigation.</p>
      <p>Director/Founder Rev. Diane Dunne told Newsday that it is believed the fire was started inside the building after rear windows were shattered.</p>
      <div class="imgdrop" id=""> <img src="images/burnt.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="189" /></div>
      <p>No injuries were reported, though damage was apparently severe in the area where the charity keeps its donated items.</p>
      <p>&quot;With Christmas and Thanksgiving right upon us, I don't know what we're going to do,&quot; Dunne told the newspaper. &quot;It's like I'm in a bad dream.&quot;</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made.</p>

      <p class="articlecredits">(Copyright &copy;2009 WABC-TV/DT. All Rights Reserved.)</p>
      
      <p>It began with one woman seeing a need and gathering some friends to make sandwiches and delivering them to the people on the streets of New York.</p>
      <p>Today <strong>Pastor Diane Dunne</strong>, and the team from from &quot;Hope For The Future Ministries&quot; are a lifeline to the many poor and homeless on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and the streets of Long Island, supplying nutritious hot meals, pantry bags and even a church where people can be accepted.</p>
      <p>Hope for the Future Ministries does more than help the poor survive. It offers them hope for the future. This is offered in many ways: </p>
      <ul><li> Weekly supply of hot meals and pantry bags to meet the </li><li> Supply of blankets and toiletries for those living on the streets.</li><li> Materials such as bedding, bathroom accessories, cooking utensils and other items to help lift an appartment from being just a room, to being a home.</li><li> A church that does not judge or condemn them for their current situation.</li><li> Counselling support for the many problems encountered in inner city life.</li><li> Connection to rehabilitation programes for those struggling with drug and alcohol dependancy.</li></ul><!--_step1-->
      <p class="qa">Does this work?</p>
      <p>Well if you are looking for a Christian ministry that really does work, just look at the results since 1987 when Pastor Diane Dunne started the ministry:</p>
      <ul><li> Over 500 hot meals served each week.</li><li> Over 2000 pantry bags supplied each week.</li><li> Over 150 people who would feel uncomfortable in a normal church, attend the Church without Walls church service every week.</li><li> Hundreds of people making a first time commitment to Jesus (compare this to the quantity in an average church).</li><li> Hundreds of people getting off of drugs and alcohol.</li></ul><!--_step1-->
      <p>Senior citizens are finding a place of comfort and companionship.</p>
      <p>Hope for the Future Ministries is looking for people like you to help out. See below for a list of the most urgent needs, however if you have a skill that you think you could offer to the ministry, please feel free to contact the office.</p>
      <p class="qa">Driving</p>
      <p>The ministry regularly receives donated food and other items which need to be collected. If you are able to drive a van and have some time available, you could be collecting items from warehouses and shops on a regular basis, or on an occasional basis when a call with an offer comes in to the warehouse.</p>
      <p class="qa">Fund Raising</p>
      <p>As you can see from the Financial Help page, the ministry needs a lot of money to run. This job is essential to the ministry as the more money that is raised, the more people the ministry can help.</p>
      <p class="qa">Youth Work</p>
      <p>There is a strong interest from youth at the locations where the ministry works. At the moment the ministry is unable to build on that interest. This position would suit someone currently studying at a bible college who is looking for an internship for experience of working with youth.</p>
      <p class="qa">PR</p>
      <p>This work requires someone with experience of getting the name of an organiza- tion well known. Although the ministry is well known where it serves the people, it is not known well enough by businesses and churches. Where it is known about, there is a need to communicate what the ministry does, and how effective it is at making a change to people's lifes.</p>
      <p class="qa">Office Admin</p>
      <p>There always seems to be more paperwork to deal with. Pastor Diane would love to be able to concentrate on what she is good at, helping and iministering to people, so the more helpers in the office, the more time she can devote to the people the ministry is there to serve.</p>
      <p class="qa">Working With Seniors</p>
      <p>As you can see on the Supporting the Elderly page, the ministry supports a large number of senior citizens. People who have a heart for senior citizens are needed to extend this side of the ministry.</p>
      <p class="qa">Cleaning</p>
      <p>To supply food to people requires a lot of warehouse, office and kitchen space as well as vans to transport the goods. The ministry needs people with a heart for excellence in to help keep the standard of the ministry to a high standard.</p>
      <p class="qa">Kitchen</p>
      <p>With over 500 hot meals and hundreds of sandwiches provided each week, there is a need for people to work in the preparation of food in the kitchen in Farmingdale. Depending on your time you can volunteer to just make sandwiches, or get involved in the cooking of the hot nutritious meals provided by the ministry.</p>
      <p class="qa">Warehouse</p>
      <p>The warehouse contins large quantities of food, drink and housewares. These are regularly supplied to people on the outreach lines, meaning the warehouse is very busy with incoming and outgoing produce, as well as moving stock around to make sure that the oldest stock is at the front of any stack. The ministry needs people who are well organised and fit enough to move heavy boxes around.</p>
      <p class="qa">Van Repair &amp; Servicing</p>
      <p>With five vans sharing over ten trips per week, they are working very hard. To save the ministry paying for regular service and day to day maintenance it is urgent to find volunteers with experience as vehicle mechanics. Work includes general servicing, oil changes and general maintenance.</p>
      <p class="qa">Team Organizing</p>
      <p>Hope for the Future Ministries offers short term opportunities for groups to come and experience serving in the inner city and urban environment. These groups come not just from Long Island, or even America, but from all over the world. The ministry is looking for a person with good organisation and communication skills to book the teams in, book space in Hope House, arrange collection from the airport if they coming from abroad, and generally make sure their time with the ministry flows smoothly.</p>
      <p class="qa">Outreach Support</p>
      <p>Many groups join the ministry to help out on the outreach days, both in the church without walls service and the line giving out the pantry bags and hot food. This is open to anbody with a heart for people. Many groups create a street drama to use as part of te church service. As with all the areas of service, please contact the office first to make sure that there is room available on the dates you wish to help out.</p>
      
      <p class="qa">God Belongs in my City</p>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago, a Brooklyn youth pastor asked a several of his student leaders why New York City atheists could launch a massive subway ad blitz with nary a public peep from local churches when, as he mused, <strong>&quot;God belongs in my city.&quot;</strong></p>
      <p>Their response to his dismay was a viral blitz online asking area students to mobilize for prayer. They created a website and a Facebook group and a YouTube video, composed and recorded an anthem, designed a simple T-shirt, and began tweeting that &quot;God Belongs in My City.&quot;</p>
      <p>Finally, they organized a silent prayer walk throughout Manhattan that will took place on Saturday, November 14. More than 1,000 teens were expected to participate, wearing T-shirts that proclaim &quot;God Belongs in My City,&quot; and blanketing the borough from 96th Street to the Battery. Join us please visit <a href="http://www.godbelongsinmycity.com">www.godbelongsinmycity.com</a></p>
      <p>If those who did not join us, please say a prayer for what God is stirring among New York City's two million young people this weekend.</p>
