      <p ><em>In 1999 my ministry was asked to participate in a CD project called All IV Jesus. All IV JESUS was a compilation CD that went out on an independent label out of the Bronx, NY. The groups on the project were the original Brothers Inc. 4 Da&rsquo; Lord, Orquesta Rubi, Brother E and a group called Jah Children. I knew each group on the CD personally except Jah Children. I had never heard of them before. They were a reggae group. Once I hit the studio and listened to a few of their tracks, there was one brother in the group that really stood out. The flow, the delivery, the passion, the sound, and the content were all on point. Back in 1999 that was huge. Not many Gospel Rappers out back then.</em></p>
      <p><em>The person who stood out on the tracks the most turned out to be Richie Righteous. Though we were never in the studio at the same time, and we were never personally introduced until months later, once we met, we connected from that point on.</em></p>
      <p>Richie is the son of a pastor and has been a powerful voice in the Gospel Hip Hop and Reggae scene for a long time. Recently participating in major events throughout the US, his ministry continues to grow and God is using Him more and more.</p>
      <p><em>In my effort to bring Gospel Hip Hop news to your eyes, I reached out to RR to find out what&rsquo;s going of late. He mentioned how he has been working on a lot of things but no one is asking to interview him. So, I went to his site and read that he was determined to sell 50,000 CDs in a week...so my question to Richie Righteous was...</em></p>
      <p><span class="qa">Bert Bocachica:</span> Rich, Here&rsquo;s your chance for coverage. Spill your heart brother. 50,000 CDs in a week? That&rsquo;s news! Give me info. You will be on the front page kid.</p>
      <p><span class="qa">Richie Righteous:</span> Yea, 50,000 CDs is the goal. The album is titled &ldquo;R.I.C.H.&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Resting in Christ Hands.&rdquo; The record is 100% me again. I have a song on the album in which I have a conversation with the devil...he is trying to convince me to sell out and he has got some strong points that expose the reality of being a Gospel rapper but, you got to hear my answer to him...the song is called patiently waiting.</p>
      <p>I also have a song on there in which I discuss that success is not defined in the amount of dollars you have, and the fact that money can&rsquo;t buy certain things that are necessary in this life....money is not evil just the love of it....the song is called can&rsquo;t take it with you because there is the basic idea that when you die, what can you take with you? Luke 12:20 says clearly...&ldquo;thou fool your soul is required tonight.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>I have a lot of good, strong material. There is a personal song on this project in which I discuss a personal sickness that challenged me and the results I got from the doctor. It&rsquo;s a very personal one; more encouraging than personal to be honest.</p>
      <p>The title is, of course, the song that says &ldquo;Resting in Christ Hands&rdquo; which I am praying that I would get my friend, Pastor Hezekiah Walker, on. I got to finish it first and present it to him.</p>
      <p>On the personal song, I am trying to feature Canton Jones, another good friend, on the hook. I could go on and on about the songs. I really dig how this album is coming along.</p>
      <p>The album also features Valerie Boyd. It will be released on Righteous Ent./ Shekinah Int'l. It will be widely distributed.</p>
      <p>Now onto the goal... Why 50,000? Well... I know what people think of immediately when they hear this. They think; &ldquo;Richie Righteous is trying to get paid&rdquo;. lol..lol. Well, the truth of the matter is that I am an independent artist and first, just the cost of recording...then buying beats..then mixing the records...then marketing it with posters, flyers, flats etc..then to get the artwork... then to actually print 50,000 CDs (to be honest I would have to print more for promotional use)...then to market it (keeping in mind that I am not trying to sell one thousand, not ten thousand but 50,000 this number exceeds way more than the average gospel rapper sells. My MySpace hits are now touching close to 80,000.. and that&rsquo;s free!! So, imagine getting 50,000 people and convincing them that they need to buy your record... and this without major radio or TV support.</p>
      <p>So as you can see, it&rsquo;s a hard task...but it can be done and it&rsquo;s necessary that we as Christian rappers start putting up numbers and charting...We need to take over the market...If they are not gonna play us on the Christian stations nor secular then we need to buy our own... why not? We need our own TV station...We are losing a generation and we cannot be quiet anymore. We gotta make noise and draw man&rsquo;s attention back to the cross... 50,000 records is making noise.</p>
      <p>Imagine with me if the world opens up Billboard or whatever magazine and sees that the number 1 record in the country is a gospel rap record from an artist who is not scared to mention Jesus in his music. Wow!!...Can you imagine what the label heads would start thinking? For years we have been complaining about lack of airplay etc..The reason for that is because we don&rsquo;t own anything. The world owns all the radio stations, TV etc..I am not gonna wait on Hot 97 (NY) to play my music to be successful. I don&rsquo;t believe BET is my destiny..lol.. To some people, the height of there career is getting on a BET, MTV etc. But I believe that we got to slay the giant. In order to do that we got to want to fight. Call me David cause I am stepping up to the plate and I have got a vision for my music.</p>
      <p>Some Christian rappers make albums with no vision for them...that&rsquo;s not me...I have a vision that I believe is from God. I an not waiting on the labels, or radio stations to get behind me. I believe that the people have seen how God has used my ministry and from the fruit of it, they will support.</p>
      <p>We need to take back this generation. As a youth leader, I see the effects of the music but I also see the effects of gospel rap too. The kids love it and I know more people would too if they know we existed. I am not asking people to send me money, I am just simply asking that &ldquo;When the album comes out in May of 2008.. GO AND COP IT.&rdquo; I need you to buy in the week it comes out. When we accomplish this...this would open doors for many, I believe.</p>
      <p>I also have a vision to make the E.R. (Emergency Room) bigger for NY and I have a vision to sign &amp; promote artists to the masses.</p>
      <p>We have got churches in this country with total membership of thirty thousand...so my questions are: Why are our sales low in the gospel market? What are believers buying? Imagine if the body begins to buy our records when they are released...we could change the face of mainstream...</p>
      <p>I could say more, Bert, but I think I said enough. lol...if u need more let me know.</p>
      <p><span class="qa">Bert:</span> So there you have it, RR is on a mission. We should all jump in to support. However, we shouldn&rsquo;t just support RR, but others who also share a heart for reaching the masses with God&rsquo;s Word using hip hop as a tool.</p>
