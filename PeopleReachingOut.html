              <p>The Christian Community has had a long tradition of compassion and supporting one another in times of need. Due to the financial crisis, unemployment and recession, support is needed now more than ever. Churches, missions and local food pantries are all in need of volunteers. The services that volunteers can provide to strengthen the community are:  helping neighbors in need, education, health, food banks, financial professionals to help those at risk of losing their homes, after school programs &amp; their local church. Sign up or call and tell them you saw their name in The L.E.</p>

      <p><strong>Rachel&rsquo;s Joy Maternity Home</strong> tailors the services we offer to the needs of the young women who come to us.

The home is able to facilitate between four to eight mothers and their babies.</p>
      <p>When a young unmarried woman becomes pregnant, our society today often views her situation as a tragedy with the only &ldquo;happy ending&rdquo; being abortion. We take our name from the Rachel of Genesis 30:22-23:</p>

<p class="qa">Dine In </p>
      <p class="articlecredits">(a citywide initiative to fight spiritual &amp; physical hunger)</p>
      <p>Imagine what Thanksgiving will be like for needy families in these challenging economic times. Already overwhelmed before the financial crisis, their struggles are even greater as they desperately try to provide life&rsquo;s basic necessities for their children. For many on this day of feasting, kitchen cabinets will lay bare with only a few cans of food on the shelves. There will be no laughter &ndash; no joy.</p>
      <p>Nearly 2 million people live below the poverty level in New York City. 1.3 million people live in households without enough to eat -- 417,000 of them are children. Many will have no meal at all to enjoy on Thanksgiving Day.</p>
      <p>You can make a difference &ndash; just <strong>Dine In</strong>!</p>
      <p>In New York City, the average cost of a dinner in a restaurant is $40.78 per person. For the cost of a meal out, you are invited to <strong>Dine In</strong> for one night and donate the money saved to provide a needy family this Thanksgiving with a Box of Love filled with food &ndash; enough for six people.</p>
      <p>Since 1987, Here&rsquo;s Life Inner City has been sponsoring Boxes of Love at Thanksgiving and is now in partnership with 130 churches and ministries. Each box is filled with a canned ham, vegetables, potatoes, juice, apple or cranberry sauce, bread, fruit, dessert, and more&hellip;including Scriptures and a clear Gospel presentation. Last year, 4,500 families received Boxes of Love in the New York City area. Boxes of Love is a nationwide campaign, which served 30,500 families through local churches and ministries across the country in 2008.</p>
      <p>One of those families moved into new accommodations in Brooklyn, but they weren&rsquo;t much better than the shelter they just left. Their apartment had one piece of furniture &ndash; a table that was left by the former tenant.</p>
      <p>One day they had a special visitor. A member of a local church arrived at their door with a Box of Love. The children were overjoyed as they pulled out two stuffed animals from the box. Their mother broke down in tears as she saw the food for her and her family. After a time of prayer together, this grateful mother expressed interest in attending this caring church. That Sunday, her whole family showed up!</p>
      <p><strong>Dine In</strong> and partner with Here&rsquo;s Life Inner City to reach out to 7,000 families in need this year. Check out the details online at <a href="http://www.hlicnyc.org">www.hlicnyc.org</a> and find out how you can follow us on <a href="http://www.Twitter.com/hlicnyc">Twitter.com/hlicnyc</a> and Facebook.</p>
      <p>Share the <strong>Dine In</strong> campaign with everyone you know &ndash; at church, in your workplace, with your schoolmates, and among your family and friends.</p>
      <p>Become a catalyst to spark a movement of compassion toward families that are hurting this Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">(Here&rsquo;s Life Inner City is the compassionate urban ministry of Campus Crusade for Christ). Boxes of Love are distributed only through HLIC - partner churches &amp; ministries.</p>

<p class="qa">The Relief Bus</p>
      <p>New York City, circa 1989. The homeless situation was desperate. Poverty and addiction plague the inner city. Hearing from God through Isaiah 58, <strong>Richard &amp; Dixie Galloway</strong> moved to New York and were given an old school bus to help the poor. The bus was customized to become a mobile soup kitchen and resource center. &quot;The Relief Bus&quot; went to where the need was. Communities become transformed one person at a time as lives are changed through the grace of God and the power of prayer. Thousands of volunteers come out to serve the poor, make friends on the streets and bring hope. As volunteers serve &quot;the least of these,&quot; their lives are impacted and they return home changed, ready to touch their own communities.</p>
      <p>In 2000, a second bus is launched to reach twice as many outreach locations as were possible be&shy;fore!</p>
      <p>Willie was homeless and came to The Relief Bus weekly for over 10 years. Because of volunteers who love him, today he is now drug free and has his own apartment. The Need is still great.</p>
      <p>Please join our monthly support team today for $25, $50, $100 or more so The Relief Bus can continue for another 20 years, working to transform the communities we serve in. All gifts are tax-deductible. Make your check out to &quot;New York City Relief&quot; or give online at <a href="http://www.reliefbus.org">www.reliefbus.org</a>. Thanks for caring.</p>
