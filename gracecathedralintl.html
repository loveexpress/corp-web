              <p ><strong><em>On January 16th, 2014 Bi&shy;shop Harris  along with several outstanding men of Long Island received a &ldquo;David Award&rdquo;  which was presented by Net&shy;working Magazine. The Love Express congratulates  Bishop Harris on his outstanding service to the community here and abroad.</em></strong></p>
              <p>A&nbsp;man of deep  faith and conviction, <strong>Bi&shy;shop</strong> <strong>R.</strong> <strong>W.</strong> <strong>Harris </strong>showed his propensity to  community service and religious ministry and from an early age. Born in St. Pe&shy;tersburg,  Florida, he grew up in East Harlem, NY, where he became a junior member of the  NAACP at the age of 17. Under the guidance of Percy Sutton, a prominent black  Ameri&shy;can lawyer, elected official, civil rights activist and business leader from the 1950s to the 1970s, the young  Harris learned about community involvement, and traveled on the NAACP bus to  the March on Wash&shy;ing&shy;ton. There, he was inspired by the thought-provoking  speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
              <p>Harris  graduated from John Jay College of Cri&shy;mi&shy;nal Justice and the F.B.I. National  Academy. He served New York City for 21 years as a member of the Housing Police De&shy;part&shy;ment, and during that  time, was dispatched to facilities throughout the five boroughs. In 1986, he  retired from law enforcement as a Detective Lieutenant.</p>
              <p>In his  last years of City employment, Harris sharpened his vision of service to God  and man. He entered the Church of Christ Bible Institute in Harlem and re&shy;ceived  a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religious Educa&shy;tion and Theology, and was  ordained in 1983.</p>
              <p>Harris  and his wife No&shy;vella, along with their four children, began religious services  on Wednesday evenings in their home in Uniondale, Long Island. To&shy;gether, they  established the Grace Cathedral In&shy;ter&shy;na&shy;tio&shy;nal  church. Under Har&shy;ris&rsquo;s ministry, the church prospered, and he as&shy;sumed  the full time position of pastor. In 1995, the church found a permanent home on  Jeru&shy;salem Ave&shy;nue. Soon after, Grace Ca&shy;thedral  purchased land from Nassau County to construct a facility to provide  quality, affordable child care, and in May  1995, opened the Sure Foun&shy;da&shy;tion Child Care Cen&shy;ter. The day-time and the  after-school programs are under the di&shy;rection of Har&shy;ris&rsquo;s wife, an elementary  school teacher with a Mas&shy;ter&rsquo;s degree in education.</p>
              <p>Ten  years later, the church expanded again. With funding from Nassau County, Town of Hemp&shy;stead and New York  State, the congregation built its Grace  Multi-Cultural Cen&shy;ter, which connects the pre-school building to the church. While funding was  available, the church provided a Saturday morning free re&shy;spite program, giving families of special needs children a break from the stres&shy;ses of  life.</p>
              <p>Two  years into his mi&shy;ni&shy;stry, Harris began leading international crusades  to Ghana, Africa, where his fa&shy;ther had  ministered before him.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;One  can&rsquo;t attend to people&rsquo;s spiritual needs when they are hungry,&rdquo; re&shy;marks  Harris, and on his vi&shy;sits, he not only preaches to the people, but also  distributes food, clothing and other  necessities. In Gha&shy;na, he also constructed a small orphanage. In  addition to three visits to Ghana, Har&shy;ris has traveled to Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and South Africa. He  conducted two crusades in Madras and Ooty,  India, as well as Cebu City in the Philippines.</p>
              <p>More  recently, Harris <u>journeyed</u> twice to Haiti  to assist in the relief effort after the  2010 earthquake that rocked the small country. After assessing the needs of the  people, he made a second crusade to Haiti, ac&shy;companied  by some 20 people - many of whom were nurses, teachers and medi&shy;cal  professionals. For this trip, he had also coordinated  with the Nas&shy;sau County Medical Center to bring me&shy;dical supplies.</p>
              <p>Harris  is mindful of the social challenges and peer pressure that young people face,  and he notes, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t provide young people with enough positive things to do, they will naturally tend toward  destructive ac&shy;tivi&shy;ties.&rdquo; The church, therefore, began a youth group, called GANG, God&rsquo;s Anoin&shy;ted New Generation. Three  students accompanied Har&shy;ris on a crusade to Ethiopia in the fall of 2013.</p>
              <p>Celebrating  its 30th an&shy;niversary, Grace Cathe&shy;dral  International has grown to include over 500 parishio&shy;ners from as far  west as Queens and Brooklyn and as far east as Suffolk Coun&shy;ty.</p>
              <p>Harris was appointed as one of three founding  Commissioners of the Nas&shy;sau County Con&shy;di&shy;tional Re&shy;lease Commission (Parole  Board). He served three years on the Com&shy;mission before resigning to accept a chaplaincy position with the County&rsquo;s Police De&shy;partment, and is now  serving in his 22nd year. Harris  also serves Nassau County as a member  of the Crimi&shy;nal Justice Coordinating Coun&shy;cil.</p>
              <p>Partnering  with the community service programs of the Nassau Coun&shy;ty Department of  Probation and the Education and As&shy;sistance  Corporation, Har&shy;ris has enabled numerous youth to successfully complete  hundreds of community service hours as an al&shy;ternative  to incarceration. In addition, he&rsquo;s partnered with the Nassau County De&shy;part&shy;ment  of Social Ser&shy;vi&shy;ces to provide a training  site for Work Experience Pro&shy;gram clients.</p>
              <p>For the  past two years, Harris has initiated a food distribution program at the Grace Cathedral location. In cooperation with  Shop Rite, the church prepares 500 bags of non-perishable groceries that are  distributed free-of-charge to the community.</p>
              <p>Harris  retains membership in NOBLE (National Organization of Black Law Enforcement  Executives), the Guardians Association (Police Chaplain) and the Board of  Directors on One Hundred Black Men of Nas&shy;sau and Suffolk Counties. He&rsquo;s a  Silver Life Member in the Freeport-Roosevelt NAACP, and serves as pre&shy;sident of  the Uniondale Clergy Association and a member of the Long Island Conference of  Clergy.</p>
              <p>Uniondale  residents since 1975, Harris and his wife, Novella, are the parents of four  grown children who are continuing the family tradition of making a difference  in our community. Darlene Harris McCabe, Esq. is a Commissioner on the Nassau  County Assess&shy;ment Review Commission; Robert Wayne Harris is an educator; Richard Troy Har&shy;ris has served as  Uniondale Fire Commissio&shy;ner; and Ja&shy;lana Harris, LMCSW is a Ph.D. candidate.</p>
