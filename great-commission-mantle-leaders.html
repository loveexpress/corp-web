            <h4>Great Commission &quot;Mantle&quot; Leaders</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Jim Biscardi Jr. </p>
            </div>
            
            
            
            <p>For many  years as a workplace leader, I was responsible  for leading and growing 25 subordinate supervisors who led and trained their  people. Also, as President of New Jersey Christian Ministries (NJCM) from 2000  &ndash; 2011, the Lord gave us hundreds of instructors and exhibitors who mentored  Convention attendees and provided them with the latest resources in almost  every area of Christian mini&shy;stry. It was my awesome privilege and  responsibility to help thousands of  Christians, from various parts of the Bo&shy;dy of Christ, mature as leaders  by receiving instruction in God&rsquo;s Word. They left the Conventions with knowledge, skill, and materials to mentor others. </p>
            <p>Many Christians are unaware of their  importance to the Lord. Do you realize, for example, that you are a lea&shy;der for  Him? There are many different kinds of leaders: workplace supervisors, pastors, deacons, husbands and wives, parents and  grandparents, teachers and coaches. Are you one of them? Then you are a  leader. Are you a Christian believer? Then you are Christ&rsquo;s ambassador, an  officer in the army of the Lord! (2 Corinthians 5:20). And you&rsquo;ve been given  the Great Commission (Matthew 28: 18-20) to go and make disciples of all  nations - to lead others to Christ and help them become mature believers. So  you too are a leader.</p>
            <p>In this article, I&rsquo;d like to share some  general qualities of Christ-like leaders we can imitate wherever we are in life  or in the Church. The mantle garment, also translated as &ldquo;cloak&rdquo;, worn by all  God&rsquo;s prophets, helps us understand what is needed to effectively develop the  people entrusted to us &ndash;children, spouses, teams, church members, other  believers or unbelievers. The mantle was a sleeveless garment made from theskins of animals with the hair left  on it. (2 Kings 2:12-14). </p>
            <p>The mantle helps us know what&rsquo;s needed  for people to be productive, empowered, and creative, who &ldquo;live by faith&rdquo; and  who take responsibility and feel accountable  for their actions. It shows us how to &ldquo;free&rdquo; our people to be all they  can be in their roles as employees, church members, children and grandchildren,  students, Chrisian believers, etc. Je&shy;sus clearly demonstrated these same qualities, and left them as a  legacy for us to emulate.</p>
            <p>Here are some things the mantle shows  us:</p>
            <p>The  mantle <strong><em>served</em></strong> the pro&shy;phet, it wasn&rsquo;t served. Besides using it as a  cloak, the pro&shy;phet might have used it as a pillow  or small shelter. So our attitude as leaders is one of <em>servant</em>-leader. In John 13: 1-17, Jesus washed the feet of His  disciples. He then told them [and us] to wash one another&rsquo;s feet - to do as He  had shown them. He said that they would be happy if they did this. Jesus said  the greatest person in the kingdom of God is the servant of all. (Luke 9:48;  Mark 9:35).</p>
            <p>The mantle also <strong><em>provi&shy;ded warmth</em></strong> for the pro&shy;phet.  We leaders need to give our people the warmth of knowing that they are  our greatest asset and highest concern. We need to take the time [like Jesus  always did] to get to know them and let them know us. God came in the flesh to  show us who He was - to gain a heart-to-heart commitment from us. (John 10: 10,  11, 14, 15). We leaders need to build a heart-to-heart relationship with those  entrusted to us.</p>
            <p>The mantle also <strong><em>provi&shy;ded protection</em></strong> from  the elements. It couldn&rsquo;t have holes that would let the rain in or be so thin  that it gave no resistance to the wind. It needed  to have &ldquo;integrity.&rdquo; As the prophet depended upon his mantle and gained  confidence in what it could do, so our people need to be able to depend upon  our sound judgment and wisdom. James 3:17 tells us that the <em>&ldquo;wisdom from above&rdquo;</em> means among other  things having pure motives, being compassionate  with failure, and gaining respect by being fair, genuine, and keeping  our word.</p>
            <p>A mantle isn&rsquo;t able to &ldquo;push&rdquo; anything -  a cloth garment has no pushing power. It can, however, be tied around something  and pull it. We leaders need to have this <strong><em>&ldquo;pull power&rdquo;</em></strong>-like Jesus.&nbsp; He always says things like <em>&ldquo;follow me&rdquo; </em>(John 12:26), and <em>&ldquo;come unto me&rdquo;</em> (Matthew 11:28). All  believers need to have this &ldquo;pull power&rdquo; to attract the lost, unite believers,  and disciple each other.</p>
            <p>If we embrace these &ldquo;mantle&rdquo; leadership  qualities, our resulting actions will send this  message to our people: &ldquo;Follow me as I follow  Christ.&rdquo; (1Corinthians 11:1). Several actions  that result are: Being a good listener; Building up and encouraging our  people; Being loyal and building loyalty; Promptly informing our people, and  involving them in setting goals; Building uni&shy;ty and family; Never taking our  people&rsquo;s good performance for granted; Providing timely feedback; Developing in  our people a heart for serving others. </p>
            <p>In these last  days, all believers need to be Christ-like leaders willing to  tie themselves to others in the pro&shy;cess of discipleship - to be ready to lead  as the Lord brings the harvest of new believers into our churches. Don&rsquo;t leave  that work to the pastors and deacons alone.</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s be the Lord&rsquo;s &ldquo;believer leaders&rdquo;  and emulate His &ldquo;mantle&rdquo; leadership qualities. And let&rsquo;s also maintain a &ldquo;new  wineskin&rdquo; heart &ndash; one that will stretch as the Lord continues pouring His truth  into us. (Luke 5: 36-39).            </p>
