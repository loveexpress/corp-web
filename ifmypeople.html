      <p><em><strong>The walls of our Jerusalem are broken down and the enemy has found a way through the gap; What are we to do? Here is an excerpt from an article on our founding fathers.</strong></em></p>
      <p class="qa">Remember 9/11</p>
      <p>When we look at the crises plaguing America we must first of all recognize that our problems are not political. They are not economic. They are not just social or moral problems. We cannot Save America and turn back to God through the election of a new government, through legislation, or simply by changing man-made laws. We must go to the root cause.</p>
      <p>At the root of the problems and crises we face in America and the nations of the world is sin. We are bringing the judgment of God upon ourselves because of our wickedness and ungodliness.</p>
      <p>The floodgates of immorality have been opened!</p>
      <p>We have turned from God to follow our own evil ways.</p>
      <p>Our condition has not come about because of spiritual ignorance. This great nation was established on a foundation that was based upon a strong  faith in God and allegiance to Him.</p>
      <p>God established America for His eternal purposes, which were attested to by our founding fathers such as George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln to name just a few. This great nation has been a tool in the hand of God for the purpose of shining and spreading the light of Christianity to the world. <strong>Noah Webster</strong>, one of our founding fathers and a leader in education, reflected the nation&rsquo;s beliefs when he stated: </p>
      <p><strong>The moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws...All the miseries and evils which men suffer, from vice, crime, ambition, injustice, oppression, slavery, and war, proceed from their despairing or neglecting the precepts contained in the Bible.</strong></p>
      <p>America was born and founded on a strong national faith and trust in God. In our Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, we declare ourselves to be &ldquo;one nation under God.&rdquo; All our currency bears the phrase <strong>&ldquo;In God We Trust.&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p>The phrase &ldquo;In God We Trust&rdquo; appears opposite the President of the Senate, who is Vice President of the United States. The same phrase, in large words inscribed in marble, forms a backdrop for the Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>America, without a doubt, was established on the foundation of Scripture. The founding fathers openly acknowledged that the strength behind our country was principles and truth in God&rsquo;s Word. From the very beginning, the basis for the law and government in American society was Biblical.</p>
      <p>For more than 200 years, God blessed and prospered America. He exalted us as one of the world&rsquo;s most powerful nations on earth and has undoubtedly used us more than any other nation to spread the Gospel to the four corners of the earth.</p>
      <p>We have turned away from God, outlawed His Word in our schools and government, and forsaken the moral principles and foundations based upon God&rsquo;s Word that once made us a strong nation and world leader.</p>
      <p>When America faced one of it&rsquo;s darkest hours in history, Abraham Lincoln recognized the need for America to remember God&rsquo;s hand of blessing and on April 30, 1863 called a &ldquo;Day of National Humiliation&rdquo; confessing the national sins and asking God&rsquo;s forgiveness. Read his words slowly and allow their meaning to penetrate your heart:</p>
      <p><strong>We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven; we have been preserved these many years in peace and prosperity; we have grown in number, wealth, and power as no other Nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all the blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of or our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success we have become to self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God who made us. It behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.</strong></p>
      <p>We have forgotten our Godly heritage. Much of America&rsquo;s birth and development, especially as it relates to our Christian foundation, has been excluded from textbooks for over 100 years. Is it any wonder that secularism has replaced the Christian principles that made our nation great and brought God&rsquo;s blessing?</p>
      <p>Every session of the House and Senate begins with prayer. There is a small prayer room in the Capitol building, just off the rotunda for the members of Congress. The room&rsquo;s focal point is a stained glass window showing George Washington kneeling to prayer. Behind him is etched the following words form <em>&ldquo;Preserve me, O&rsquo;God, for in Thee do I put my trust.&rdquo;</em></p>
      <p>As a nation, we turned away from God when we rejected prayer and God&rsquo;s Word as a guideline and foundation for our moral standards and in developing the laws governing our nation.</p>
      <p><strong>When you pray for our nation, first ask God forgive our national sins.</strong></p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Repent that in America</strong> we no longer hold marriage as a sacred institution between a man and a woman but have passed laws recognizing and accepting homosexuality and condoning same sex marriages.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Repent that we have rejected</strong> the truth, rejected the Bible from our schools and government institutions.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Confess and repent</strong> to God for every stand our nation has taken contrary to His standards of living.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>In the churches, we must</strong> humble ourselves before God, from the leadership to the pew. We must cry out and ask God to reveal our true condition and the sins we have allow to enter the Church: division, competition, jealousy, pride, covetousness, selfishness, to name a few.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>We must repent of apathy</strong> that has caused Christians to close their eyes and ears to the sin, gross immorality, and spiritual degradation around them and our failure to make our voices heard.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Ask God to release</strong> the conviction of the Holy Spirit, a spirit of true repentance and salvation in every city and in every area of our society.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Stand on Psalm 91</strong> and ask God to raise up an impenetrable shield of His protection upon America&rsquo;s borders, harbors, airways, water reservoirs, and power plants.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Ask God to thwart</strong> the plans and stop all attacks of all evil forces that would attempt to strike against the United States and to expose terrorists and bring them to justice. Pray for all those in authority in our nation (1 Timothy 2:2). Ask God to change the hearts of ungodly men now holding positions in our government or to remove them and establish righteous leadership in their places.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Intercede for President Obama</strong> and all those God has raised up in our government to stand for Godly Christian principles and fight against the forces of Satan in this nation.</p>
      <p>&bull; <strong>Ask God for an outpouring</strong> of His Spirit in unprecedented proportions that will result in a multitude of souls coming into the Kingdom of God. Cry out, &ldquo;Oh, God, revive us - do it again.&rdquo;</p>
