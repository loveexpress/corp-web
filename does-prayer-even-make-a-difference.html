              <p ><em>Jesus told his disciples a  story about how they should keep on praying and never give up. (Luke 18:1 CEV)</em></p>
              <p>Let&rsquo;s be honest here.&nbsp; How many times have you prayed and prayed&hellip;  and praaaayed about something in your life, only to see no change and no  affirmative answer to your prayer?</p>
              <p>Perhaps  you prayed for a sick loved one to get better, and he/she died. </p>
              <p>Perhaps  you prayed for your marriage to improve, and it worsened. </p>
              <p>Perhaps  you prayed for your finances to come up, and they went down. </p>
              <p>Perhaps  you prayed for a lost friend&rsquo;s heart to soften, and it hardened.</p>
              <p>Perhaps  you prayed for a different outcome to the 2014 election, and it didn't happen. </p>
              <p>What  gives when you pray about something heavy on your heart, something you feel is  good and right, and He doesn't do as you requested.&nbsp; Have you ever gotten discouraged in prayer,  secretly wondering if it even makes a difference? </p>
              <p class="qa">PRAYER MAKES A DIFFERENCE!</p>
              <p>To  be sure, prayer is always right and always makes a difference, even when the  results don&rsquo;t go the way you wanted. </p>
              <p><strong>1.&nbsp; Sometimes we pray the wrong thing, and God  says, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; </strong>&nbsp;He, being omniscient, knows what we need and  what we don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He knows what is truly  good for us in the long run, and what is not.&nbsp;  When we get a direct &ldquo;no&rdquo; to our prayers, it is God&rsquo;s way of saying,  &ldquo;You are barking up the wrong tree in this request.&nbsp; You are asking me for something that would  not be truly beneficial to you in your walk with Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Remember, God&rsquo;s priority is not to make you  happy, but to make you holy.&nbsp; And as you  and I grow in holiness, we grow in happiness and real joy. </p>
              <p>Job,  who had his share of prayers go awry, said, &ldquo;I know that You can do all things,  and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted&rdquo; (Job 42:2).&nbsp; God will not violate His Word and His Will to  answer your prayer.&nbsp; Every &ldquo;no&rdquo; from God  is an opportunity for us to pray differently.&nbsp;  Even a spiritual heavy weight like Moses got a &ldquo;no&rdquo; from God.&nbsp; In response to his request to go into the  Promised Land &ndash; even though God had already told him he wasn't going to let him  go in &ndash; God said, &ldquo;Enough! Speak to Me no more of this matter&rdquo; (Deut.  3:26).&nbsp; Moses had to change his prayer &hellip;  and sometimes we do too because we don&rsquo;t see the bigger picture. </p>
              <p><strong>2.&nbsp; Sometimes we pray the right thing, and God  says, &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; </strong>In this case, the prayer is right, but the timing is  wrong. There is more work that needs to be done in us and in the circumstances  around us.</p>
              <p>It  is important to remember that God is NOT some heavenly slot machine who must  pay out if you put in enough &ldquo;prayer&rdquo; coins.&nbsp;  Affirmatively answered prayed is not the ultimate goal of prayer.&nbsp; Communion and fellowship with God is the  ultimate goal. Entering into God&rsquo;s presence and talking with Him from your  heart is what He really wants and what will really change you.</p>
              <p>How  hard is it for the God who spoke the worlds into existence to answer your  prayer for finances, or health, or a job?&nbsp;  It&rsquo;s as easy as pie.&nbsp; But, how  hard is it for God to change your life and make you a man or woman of character  and Christ-likeness?&nbsp; That is another  matter altogether, and prayer (along with Bible study) is the main vehicle God  has given us to make that happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p><strong>3.&nbsp; Sometimes we pray the near-right thing, and  God says, &ldquo;I've got a bigger and better idea.&rdquo; </strong>&nbsp;Perhaps you join  with the multitudes who pray for righteousness to prevail in an election &hellip; that  Americans would rise up and repudiate candidates who espouse a biblically  immoral agenda. Even if that prayer is not answered affirmatively, it is not a  wasted prayer. </p>
              <p>God  is getting ready to answer that prayer in a bigger and better way.&nbsp; Jesus Christ, the Righteous Judge, is one day  closer to returning to planet earth to set up His righteous rule and reign.&nbsp; You see, the Bible makes it clear that things  get progressively worse before His coming.&nbsp;  But when He comes, all is made right.&nbsp;  In that coming day, His perfect will shall be the order of the day.&nbsp; Love and joy and peace and safety will cover  the land as the waters cover the sea.&nbsp; I  can&rsquo;t wait!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <p>My  friend, if you have gotten discouraged in your prayers &hellip; keep praying.&nbsp; He is good.&nbsp;  He is God, and He never makes a mistake.&nbsp;  He longs to hear from you and change you as you marinate in His awesome  presence.&nbsp; Jesus said, &ldquo;Pray all the time  and never give up&rdquo; (Luke 18:1 GW).&nbsp; Will  you do it?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
