              <p >Father,  because of your Word, I have the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge of God. So I  covenant with You now to always give voice to your Word. I will never give voice to the words of the enemy. I  will give no place to the devil. But I give place to the Spirit of God. You  have given the angels charge over me in all my ways, and my way is the way of  the Word.</p>
<p>These  things will surely come to pass, for thy Word is within me. I&rsquo;m redeemed from  the curse of the law. I&rsquo;m delivered from the powers of darkness. I&rsquo;m translated  into the kingdom of the Son of God. The Greater One dwel&shy;leth in me, so I&rsquo;ll  not fail, for your Word is within me.</p>
              
              <p>Your Word  will cause me to prevail. Even though a thousand may fall by my side and ten  thousand at my right hand, it shall not come nigh me, for You&rsquo;ve given your angels charge over me. They keep me in  all Thy ways and in my pathway is life. My pathway is health. My pathway is  prosperity, for Abraham&rsquo;s blessings are mine!</p>
              <p>Christ  redeemed me from poverty. He redeemed me from sickness. He redeemed me from  spiritual death. Therefore, in the Name of  Jesus, I give voice to your Word. I am the redeemed of the Lord, and I&rsquo;m saying  so!</p>
              <p>I forbid  any sickness or disease to operate in my bo&shy;dy. I forbid any tumor of growth to  exist in my body. It disappears. It dissolves.</p>
              
              <p>Body, I&rsquo;m  speaking to you! You come into line with the Word of God! I&rsquo;m delivered from  growths and tumors. They have no right to exist. That which God has not planted  is rooted out!</p>
              
              <p>Galatians  3:13 is in my mouth. Galatians 3:13 is flowing in my bloodstream. Galatians  flows to every cell of my body. Galatians 3:13 is forming itself in my body.  The Word is becoming flesh, for You sent your Word and healed me.</p>
              
              <p>So your Word is now be&shy;ing formed in my body. It  causes growths to disappear. It causes sickness to flee. It causes arthritis to  disappear. My bones and joints function properly. Arthritis, you MUST GO!  Sickness, you MUST FLEE! For the Spirit of God is upon me. The Word of God is  within me. I will fear no evil, for the Word of the Lord comforts me.</p>
              
              <p>Thus  saith the Lord: I&rsquo;m far from oppression. Thus saith the Lord: Fear does not  come nigh me. Thus saith the Lord; No weapon formed against me will prosper,  but whatever I do WILL PROSPER! I am the redeemed of the Lord. This is the  heritage of the servants of the Lord, and my righteousness is of God!</p>
              
              <p>Heavenly Father, I make a covenant with You to voice your Word. The Spirit of Truth within me will  guide me into all truths. He will teach me all things. He will take of yours  and show it to me. I see these things belong to me. I proclaim now that they  are mine! The devil shall not steal them.</p>
              
              <p>I will  walk in prosperity. I will walk in health, for the Word of god is come unto me.  The Greater One is in me. The Greater One will put me over. I will NOT FAIL! I  will not fear! I will not tremble when tragedy seems near, for your Word will  destroy the enemy&rsquo;s work and will keep him far from my house.</p>
              
              <p>Even  though many may fall by my side, I will proclaim your Word. Evil will not come  nigh me. I loose the angels. I charge the angels with your words, and the  ministering spirits of God to garrison about my home, my family, my finances,  and guide into the wisdom of God. This shall be by the words of my mouth, by  the Spirit of God, by the Word of God, and by the angels of God.</p>
              
              <p>Father,  You keep me in perfect peace, for my mind is stayed on You. Because of that,  I&rsquo;ll not enter the fight, but I&rsquo;ll lift up my hands and rejoice! I&rsquo;ll stand to  the true height of your Word, and I&rsquo;ll not let it go out of my sight. <em>And I will NOT ENTER into the fight!</em></p>
              
              <p>For You  will fight for me! The angels of God will work for me, and the Spirit of God  within me shall reveal the hidden things.</p>
              
              <p>I confess now that I have perfect  knowledge of every situation. I do not lack for the wisdom of God, for I have the mind of Christ. The wisdom of God is  formed within me, so I rejoice! The enemy is defeated!  God is exalted, and your Word is Lord of my life!</p>
              <p>Father, I  covenant with You to be what You said I am. Even though I don&rsquo;t look like it, I  may not act like it, I may not feel like it, You said I was, so I must be!</p>
              
              <p>I have  overcome! I have overcome the enemy because the Greater One is in me! My faith  is the victory that overcomes the world, and it comes by your Word. So I  rejoice! I won&rsquo;t weep in despair. I won&rsquo;t wring my hands and weep in prayer.</p>
              <p>But I&rsquo;ll come boldly to the Throne of  Grace with rejoicing my petition to bare. I&rsquo;ll en&shy;ter into the new way, and  I&rsquo;ll speak the things that You say. And I&rsquo;ll walk in victory, and I&rsquo;ll praise  your Name, and from this day I&rsquo;ll never be the  same.</p>
