              <p>Who can  find a virtuous woman? This question is a common biblical reference of the  quest to identify a woman of godly character, nobility, grace and honor easily  answered, by those who knew and loved Lady Lois Elaine Rochford. The  quintessential First Lady, who was also a pastor, preacher, prayer warrior,  mother, wife, entrepreneur and style icon,  embodied the essence of Proverbs 31, and lived her life with unwavering  commitment to her call. Lady Lois fulfilled her life&rsquo;s work on earth and on  October 18, 2014, transitioned from labor to reward at the age of 59 years old.</p>
              <p>Born and bred in Brooklyn, New York,  Pastor Lois thrived as a young woman and gave her life to the Lord as a  teenager. Her adolescence was marked by her commitment to ministry and  spiritual growth, as she grew up under the tutelage of Bi&shy;shop Roy Brown and  the Pilgrim Church. She demonstra- ted  commitment to prayer and gleaned from the mothers of the church who taught her  to pray and intercede; an anointing and conviction that would follow her into  adulthood.</p>
              <p>As she grew and matured in faith, life  and mini&shy;s&shy;try, Lois assumed her most beloved roles as wife and eventually  mother, when she met and married a young evangelist, know then as Re&shy;verend  Robert Joel Roch&shy;ford. From this union came her  two children, Melaine and Robert II, who she abso&shy;lu&shy;te&shy;ly adored. For  34 years, Lady Lois walked diligently beside her husband Bishop Roch&shy;ford, as  the two built and established New Life  Cathedral, where she founded life-changing ministries and groomed men  and women to walk in the fullness of&nbsp;  their God-ordained purposes. She walked  diligently beside him and served as the Executive Pastor until her transition.</p>
              <p>Lady  Lois was a powerhouse and personality all her own. With a preaching style and  gift for prayer, counsel and spiritual impartation, she impacted lives through  service and had a conviction and anointing to minister especially to women. She  mentored and mothered with dedication and care, adopting many spiritual  children and groomed young first la&shy;dies who sought her counsel and gleaned  from her wisdom. She was well known for her candor, humor and practical  teaching, as well as her pristine sense of fashion and style. As she traveled the country, she left her mark on the hearts of those who came to know her and  her &ldquo;Lois-isms&rdquo;; the phrases she often used to share her love for life and  those in it.</p>
              <p>Evidence of the fruit of her life and legacy was noted by a two-day  celebration on October 25&ndash;26, 2014, where nearly  5,000 people crow&shy;ded both the New Life Cathedral and the Pilgrim  Renaissance Center to honor and celebrate her legacy. Countless tributes shared  anecdotes that were true to her loyalty, generosity and commitment to  friendship, family and fun. She was truly a gift to the body of Christ, and to  all who knew her.</p>
              <p>To honor her memory and celebrate her  birthday, there will be a <strong>benefit  concert</strong> on <strong>February 6, 2015</strong> and  a memorial service on <strong>Sunday,</strong> <strong>February</strong> <strong>8th</strong>; both held at the <strong>New  Life Cathedral</strong>, located at <strong>110  Junius Street</strong> in <strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>.  The concert will support the Lois Rochford Memorial Fund, a newly formed  organization that will support young wo&shy;men in need and train them with life  skills, readying them for both ministry and professional growth and success. </p>
              <p><strong><em>For information on these services, please contact New Life  Cathedral or visit the website at www. newlifeny.org.</em></strong></p>
