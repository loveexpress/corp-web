              </p>
            </div>
      <p >Greetings in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. I am writing this article to discuss a growing concern that I believe our LORD has placed on my heart and mind. The people of God who call Him by name and know Him as both Lord and Savior are battling diseases and mental health diagnosis in doubt and shame. In my experience, I have encountered many people of faith who have conflict with their faith and diagnosis. This conflict has resulted in missed medical appointments, poor medication adherence and unnecessary exacerbation of their physical and mental health problems. Their health diminishes, family relationships are affected, and ministry is too short. Due to the lack of trust in medicine and treatment, believers go home to be with the LORD too soon. Just as the dark grey clouds cover the beauty of the sun&rsquo;s rays so are those who are secretly depressed, anxious and face chronic life threatening illness. Some may say it should not be so, but it is a reality, which is the reason for writing this article.</p>
      <p>Many are in isolation secretly keeping their health and mental health problems from their elders.  Many feel that going to the doctor and not listening to the signs and symptoms of their ailments is not trusting God.  After a period of suffering with symptoms (physical and/or emotional pain), only then do they finally schedule an appointment with a medical provider. When a believer has been diagnosed with a life threatening illness, it is very difficult to accept.  People of faith experience the same shock and disbelief as do nonbelievers if they receive the news of cancer, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, lupus, diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart disease, scoliosis, seizure disorder and how can we forget asthma, it is hard for them to fathom.  A believer was heard saying &ldquo;How could this happen to me?  What have I done wrong?&rdquo;, as if walking under a curse. Many also hide mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorder. The response many times is the battle cry in this chant, &ldquo;whose report will you believe, we shall believe the report of the Lord&rdquo;. After singing this song on so many Friday or Sunday services, it is understandable to have conflict with Faith and Diagnosis. How can we believe that something is in our body consisting of tumors, abnormalities or chemical imbalances that are hurting us when the worship leader/preacher told me in the worship song &ldquo;I am healed, I am free, and I have the Victory&rdquo;. What happens when we return to work and the daily routine where headaches come, the dizziness, the pain, the suffering? The quote from Psalm 22 becomes so real, &ldquo;My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me&rdquo;. Where is God? Doesn&rsquo;t He know I am suffering?  Cannot my God heal me in my hour of trouble?  We all look for the divine healing yet doubt begins to germinate like weeds that seek to strangle the fertility in a plant.</p>
      <p>God gives us His word that we are to remain on this earth up to 120 years. Most of us have trouble surviving after retirement (65) living up to age 85. When our vehicles break down do we pray that the breaks will work and the squeaks will go away or that the motor oil will regenerate itself without a trip to the quick lube? Hardly. Do we allow our homes to fall apart without maintenance? How much more do we array ourselves with clothing and apparel adorning ourselves for our King and yes to seek approval from others. We abhor old clothing and either throw them away or donate them to a worthy cause. Keeping our body and mind healthy is often neglected where we deny the symptoms (God&rsquo;s designed sensors) telling us we need to seek help. Scheduling a visit to a medical doctor is quite difficult for some. Some have more wisdom taking care of the material things than the most important, our body and mind.</p>
      <p>Question, what happened to Lazarus after Jesus resurrected him? Meaning did Lazarus remain alive forever on the earth? The centurion&rsquo;s servant? Jarius daughter after Jesus raised her from her sleep? No they all eventually died; something must have shut down on them in their body. Is God still on the throne? Yes, I believe he is sovereign over all things. He will turn all things to the good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose.  For the time we have on the Earth is very precious indeed. How long we live is dependent on us in how we care for the temple of the Holy Spirit</p>
      <p>As a born again Christian, we anticipate and long for the miraculous. We believe God heals the sick, opens the blind eyes, and cleanses the lepers. I know God still performs miracles every day. Yet in many cases, we find the Lord chooses not to. Why? Either God is a cosmic sadist as C. S Lewis wrote in &ldquo;A Grief Observed&rdquo; when he ventilated his anger toward God after his wife died of cancer. Questions of personal sin in ones life arises as the reason for the affliction. Could the cause for this illness be unfaithfulness to God?  Some consider the following bias of Job&rsquo;s three friends as the Christian perspective.  They lacked true discernment in their explanation for Job&rsquo;s physical and personal troubles. Yes, even Job&rsquo;s wife decided for him that he should curse God and just die. Should the afflicted just curse God and die?  Is that what our Heavenly Father desires? Should they conveniently die and leave us alone, us--the healthy, upright, sanctified and elect of God? Is this the heart of Father God? Is this the compassion and humanity of the Son of God from the Gospels? No! I say my brothers and sisters; this is the season where the Christian should stand in defense of the child of God.  Thereby, allowing God to take the believer on the journey He wants them to go through in order that God be glorified in and through their suffering. <em>&ldquo;Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory&rdquo; 2 Corinthians 4:16 &amp; 17.</em></p>
      <p>After having many individual and family counseling sessions I have found that obstacles to medical and mental health treatment are their conflicts with theology. However when the reality of their diagnosis is accepted and treatments are accepted in the context of their personal Faith their health and mental health is greatly improved. In quote of people of Faith who have resolved this matter they have said, &ldquo;God gave us doctors and medicine to help us fight this disease&rdquo;. They live longer healthier productive lives able to be a blessing wherever they go.</p>
      <p><em>A majority of physicians in a large survey declared that religion and spirituality, including divine intervention, affect their patients&rsquo; health. The survey of more than a thousand practicing physicians found that 56% believe religion and spirituality have a significant effect on health, researchers reported in the April 9, 2009 issue of the</em> <strong>Archives of Internal Medicine.</strong></p>
      <p>I have encountered many who because of early detection of their diagnosis are living productive lives in both the secular and church realms. They are eternally grateful to God for their doctors, specialty care, surgeries, treatments and therapy that has extended their lives to be with their families, life work and ministry. Mentioning this to me in private is common, but for some it would be quite difficult to share this in a fellowship with other congregates who would tell them, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have enough faith&rdquo;, or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not how my God healed me&rdquo;, &ldquo; why are you taking that medicine you know the side effects will make it worse for you&rdquo;. Can we respond in compassion and love to those who are suffering with afflictions. Job said, &ldquo;Surely even now my witness is in heaven, and my evidence is on high. My Friends scorn me; my eyes pour out tears to God. Oh, that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!  For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of no return.  My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished, the grave is ready for me.  Are not mockers with me? And does not my eye dwell on their provocation?  Now put down a pledge for me with yourself. Who is he who will shake hands with me? (Job 16:19 &ndash; 17:3). Can we be a comfort to those among us who want us to hold their hand and plead their case to God and others?</p>
      <p>Let us share wisdom and truth in love, power and sound mind, to our brethren. When we take care of our body and mind (temple of the Holy Spirit), God is glorified and receives the honor and praise. I am certain Jesus wants us to have spiritual common sense in this matter. I recall how when my wife and I were on our way to minister at a Children&rsquo;s Campaign I experienced severe back pain where I had to utilize a cane to walk.  I am diagnosed with three herniated discs in my lower back. I prayed for my healing my wife prayed for me.  You know in Faith we went anyway to the children service buy the time I drove up to the church I no longer needed a cane and was able to minister with energy and excitement. I know God healed me that day and empowered me for service for His honor and glory. I still have problems with my back now and again and now have begun to receive physical therapy to help me function better and prevent another episode occurring with my back.  I have no conflict with my Faith because of my diagnosis and accept the treatment and medicine that God has provided. Can someone say Amen?</p>
