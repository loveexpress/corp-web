                Courtship and Dating is a very controversial subject. Send all emails to (love.express@verizon.net) c/o jmattera@resurrectionchurchofny.com<br>
                Let us walk in love for all the children, teens and young adults.</p>
              
              
              <p>Courtship  and dating are some of the least discussed topics in the church. Yet dating has  caused the most havoc, destroyed countless lives, resulted in unwanted pregnan-  cies and abortions, and even split churches apart. Since most of the church  doesn&rsquo;t teach on this subject, a va&shy;cuum exists resulting in our teenagers  adopting the worldview of popular culture. This has led many church youth  groups to become havens for dating and premarital sex.</p>
              <p>On  this Valentine&rsquo;s Day week I am attempting to give some biblical clarity on this  all-important subject for the sake of our local churches and for the sanctity  and safety of the next generation who will soon have their own families. The  following are guidelines that best fit young people but many of the principles still  apply to older and more mature single adults looking for a mate.<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
              <p>I have taught each of my five children  the difference between dating and courtship. Dating is an unbiblical method  crafted by the world with no boundaries or ethics with the following assumed  rules and values:</p>
              <p>&bull; Two people can mutually claim to be  &ldquo;boyfriend and girlfriend&rdquo; if they are physically attracted to one another and  (this is the litmus test) have a crush and claim each other for themselves in a  special relationship.</p>
              <p>&bull; There are no boundaries or ethics in this  type of relationship. Thus, what initially starts off as French kissing quickly  accelerates to petting, fondling, and then full-blown sexual intimacy.</p>
              <p>&bull; Although they are committed to one another  as &ldquo;boy&shy;friend and girlfriend&rdquo; they most often end their relationship after  several months when one &ldquo;feels a crush&rdquo; for someone else. Thus, the  relationship ends with at least one of the individuals feeling devastated and wounded especially because of  soul ties that were created from sexual intimacy.</p>
              <p>Although the  above three points are generalizations, they are true depictions  of most cases regarding dating; its devastating results on the human soul  cannot be fully measured! Even worse, the double-mindedness that results from  numerous sexual encounters with various people carries into future  relationships and even marriage. This is because of unhealthy soul ties that  have been developed, increasing the chan&shy;ces  one&rsquo;s marriage will end in adultery and  divorce which drags down children and creates generational curses due to  family fragmentation.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that most churches and  youth groups do not speak about this in their discipleship processes! Every  pastor should have church guidelines that include boundaries for how their  youth groups should be conducted. Every youth pastor should be trained on the difference between the world- ly concept of dating and the biblical concept  of court&shy;ship.</p>
              <p>Dating is revolutionized if the  following guidelines are followed:</p>
              <p>&bull; Dating  should only take place in the context of having an accompanying chaperone with  young couples.&nbsp; Or, only group dating  should be encouraged. Groups can go to a movie or have an outing, or go for  dinner so that two people can sit together and get to know one another in the  safety of other trusted believers.</p>
              <p>&bull; Dating  should not be encouraged for anyone under a certain age. I would say at least  18 although others would say 16.</p>
              <p>&bull; Dating  should not involve any physical contact. Even something as harmless as a hug can lead to petting which will then lead  to a sexual encounter.</p>
              <p>&bull; Youth  groups should be taught that believers should not commit themselves to anyone  God hasn&rsquo;t clearly indicated will eventually be their spouse. This is the only way to avoid soul ties through sexual  intimacy. Also, pa&shy;rents, pastors, or trusted mature people should all be part  of the process of discerning the will of God to counter the blindness that  comes when feeling in love.</p>
              <p>&bull; Youth  should be taught to have greater criteria beyond physically attraction. They  should be taught what to look for in a lifelong partner: someone who has God-given aspirations with  their career, an education, the right concepts of family and God, the ability  to handle money well, connected to a local church, etc.</p>
              <p>&bull; People should be taught to back off and not  run to a person to whom they are attracted.This is to give them- selves enough  time to pray, seek counsel, and hear from God about the other person before  they fall hopelessly in love and reach the point where their heart has alrea&shy;dy  made a choice to be with the other person&ndash;whe&shy;ther it be the will of God or  not!</p>
              <p>&bull; Youth should make  chastity vows before they enter high school. With these vows they should pledge to their parents before  God they will not give their bodies over unless they are married to the other  person.</p>
              <p><strong>Courtship</strong></p>
              <p>Although the Bible does not lay out  specifics regarding courtship, since some of the biblical marriages were  arranged by families (for example, the Old  Testament patriarch Isaac and his wife Rebecca were brought together supernaturally by God with the order  of Abraham), when we piece together all the principles of Scripture we have a  good plan for court&shy;ship.</p>
              <p>Courtship based on the biblical model of  love, romance, sacrifice, dignity, and cove&shy;nant implies the following about  how two people could begin a process that may eventually lead to marriage:</p>
              <p><strong><em>Pre-Courtship  Stage:</em></strong></p>
              <p>A person should not even begin to look  for a mate unless they are adequately prepared for the responsibilities of  marriage and family, and are themselves emotionally healthy and spiritually  mature. (When two emotionally needy people get  together in marriage it is usually a disaster!)</p>
              <p>Go on group dates to get to know the  other person or work with them in some meaningful innocuous way. This will  enable the development of a deep friendship to help discern the will of God  before beginning the pro&shy;cess of committing to each other more formally.</p>
              <p>Both parties  should back off, receive counsel, and pray to hear from God with other  mature leaders and/or parents before allowing their hearts to be pulled towards  each other romantically. Part of discerning the will of God is judging whether  or not the other person meets the biblical criteria and qualifications of being  a good mate, being able to raise children, and being a family leader.</p>
              <p>Attraction should never be only  physical. Based on 1 Thessalonians 5:23 we should be attracted to ano&shy;ther  person in three areas: physically, emotionally, intellectually &amp; spiritually (this includes personality). That  is to say, a person needs to meet the criteria in each of these three areas. For example, it is a huge  mistake to marry a person because they are strong spiritually when not  attracted to them physically. Or, it is a mistake to marry a person for their  personality when their spiritual life is a mess, etc.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Courtship  Stage:</em></strong></p>
              <p>Two people who have confirmed it is the  will of God for them to be together should begin  a process of spending time together. They should make a covenant together  before God involving strict guidelines for not  having phy&shy;sical contact or being alone where they can fall into sexual  sin, and walking in the light and having open communication with one another.</p>
              <p>This  process should involve marital counseling  conduc&shy;ted by older, successful married couples with spiritual depth and  experience in raising strong families.</p>
              <p>At some point, the man should formerly  ask the wo&shy;man&rsquo;s father, parent, or relevant guardian for permission to marry  the woman before he officially proposes to her.</p>
              <p>Both families should get to know each  other since marriage also unites two families, not just two people.</p>
              <p>Money should be set aside during the engagement, and jobs and  education should be already secured. This is so the focus of the first few  years of marriage is on building the relationship rather than on the  distractions that come from financial stress, education, and other things that  can destroy a relationship. (Although ma&shy;ny make a good case for people to get  married young so they can mature emotionally together) Going into debt and  spending a lot of money on the wedding ceremony is not advised. Monies should be channeled for life together more than on  the one-time wedding ceremony. If you don&rsquo;t have the money, be simple and  modest with excellence on your wedding day. Don&rsquo;t overdo it and go into huge  debt! Invest in your marriage, not in your wedding day!</p>
              <p>During the courtship Bi&shy;ble studies  should be done together on the role of husbands and wives, and the purpose of  children (Genesis 1:28). The book of Proverbs should be studied frequently  together for practical wisdom and prudence in  relationships and business.</p>
              <p>Couples should especially study biblical  love as found in 1 Corinthians 13 and understand that it is the commitment that  arises out of covenant that will sustain their marriage&ndash;not merely the feeling  of love. (For example, someone may wake up without those strong feeling of  romance and be deceived into thinking they are no longer &ldquo;in love&rdquo; with their  mate. This gives an excuse to begin another search for their true &ldquo;soul mate&rdquo;  to experience romance again!) All couples must understand the difference  between romantic feelings/the world&rsquo;s definition of love and the biblical  definition of love which is based on action, commitment, and sacrifice.</p>
              <p>During courtship much prayer should be  offered for wisdom, favor, and understanding</p>
              <p>Mentor couples should be secured both  during the courtship stage and after the marriage takes place. Mentor couples  are experienced married couples who take younger couples under their wings, coaching them through personal issues  that will eventually come up.</p>
              <p>The courtship should last as long as  necessary to work out all the kinks in the relationship. No date for the  wedding should be set until numerous marital empowerment sessions and  counseling sessions are conducted (we do eight sessions in our church called  Marriage Builders), and a test from Marriage Savers is taken (www.marriagesavers.org).  This will further insure the will of God is known and there is compatibility  between the two people.&nbsp; (Regarding the  Marriage Savers test, 25% of engaged couples that take the test break up. They  realize they don&rsquo;t have enough compatibility to make a marriage work.)</p>
              <p>No doubt, some reading this will scoff  at my old-fashioned approach. But after 30 plus years of marriage, and having  five biological children and hundreds of spiritual children over the past  34&nbsp; years of full-time church mi&shy;ni&shy;stry,  the aforementioned principles come out of  watching many relationship succeed and many fall apart.</p>
