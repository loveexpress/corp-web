            <p >The Praise Ship has taken off again, <strong>first stop</strong> was in Brooklyn, NY at <strong>Wayside BC</strong> for the unveiling of the street sign honoring the late Rev. Joe Louis Parker, named Rev Joe Louis Parker Way, previously Chauncey street. It was a beautiful day for a celebration and a celebration it was. Family, church family, politicians&rsquo; friends and well-wishers came by to honor this great man. The borough President Marty Markowitz stopped by, Assembly William Boyland Jr.  and others. Rev. Akin O. Royall Pastor of Bright Light BC was our master of ceremony for the day, a great job he did. It was such a pleasure to see <strong>First lady Frances Parker</strong> and her two handsome sons. <strong>Pastor Zidde Hamatheite</strong> now the pastor of Wayside BC spoke words of appreciation, love and encouragement. Pastor Parker touched so many lives and he was a true servant of God and served his community and church well. Parker is the example of what a true leader is.</p>
              <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic"><img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="219" id="authorpic" />            </div>
              <p><strong>Next stop</strong> was in Brooklyn at the All People&rsquo;s apostolic church for the celebra- tion of <strong>Dr. Emma McBride</strong> for 42 years of service for the Lord. This woman of God has been in the trenches giving her life for the people of God and the building of His kingdom. So many people came out to celebrate this woman of God, such as, the Golden Tones, Johnson Bros, Sunlight Singers and the St Luke Youth Choir, with our beautiful MC the beautiful, Rev Henrietta McBride. The St. Luke youth choir stuck in my mind the most, because they had this little boy about 4 yrs old with a play guitar, he played it as though it was the real deal. You can tell he was born into music for music was born into him. Mother McBride we celebrate you and your life, for the people you have taught and touched we thank you.</p>
              <p><strong>Next stop</strong> at First Calvary BC, where the Pastor is <strong>Rev. Earl Jones Jr.</strong> for Sunday worship we had a surprise visit from <strong>Ms. Tameca Marsden</strong> an awesome psalmist &amp; songwriter from Virginia Beach, VA. Ms. Marsden has been singing all of her life and she has dedicated herself to kingdom building. This woman of God is anointed for time such as this, she doesn&rsquo;t sing, she sang.  Tameca believes knowing where you are in God and being comfortable where God has placed you is the best place to be. I asked Tameca if she could leave a legacy for our young people, what it would be. Tomeca replied &ldquo;A legacy of worship, a new generation of worship that goes beyond the remnants of the veil.&rdquo; Tameca went on to say, she is so grateful that balancing ministry and family was not difficult because of the wonderful support system she has, this has made the transition easier. What I found really special was that her husband is her manager and they work as a team as one body in Christ. I pray that God continue to bless your endeavors and may you receive all that he has to offer.</p>

              <p><strong>Last stop</strong> was the El Caribe for the birthday banquet for one of the world&rsquo;s greatest Pastor, preacher, teacher, father, husband, friend in the man of none other than <strong>Bishop Eric Garnes</strong>. I have to say Bishop Garnes' staff &amp; church family know how to put on a Pastor&rsquo;s banquet. El Caribe knows how to take care of their guest, but who Bishop Garnes is, I expect nothing less, since he is man of perfection. The food was spectacular, atmosphere to die for and the music, a live band, awesome. Many guests came to honor the man of the hour, such as, Councilman Nick Perry, Bishop Liston Page Sr., &amp; First Lady Page, Bishop Van, Co-Pastor Beverly Caesar &ndash; Sherrod and many others. I love Bishop&rsquo;s church family they always go out of their way to make it special for my husband and me. To Bishop Garnes thank you for just being you and being a man of integrity and honor.</p>
              <p>To all of the wonderful people that read my article every month thank you. On behalf of my beautiful editor <strong>Edith Stranges, Love Express staff,</strong> and yours truly <strong>Ms. Gee</strong> Happy New Year.</p>
