            <h4>Would You Fellowship With Me?</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Jim Biscardi Jr. </p>
          </div>
            
            
            
            <p>Jesus  said, &ldquo;Abide in Me, and I in you.&nbsp; As the  branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you except you abide in Me.  I am the vine, you are the branches.&nbsp; He  that abides in Me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without  Me, you can do nothing.&rdquo; John 15: 4-5. </p>
            <p>Fellowship is one of the six important  ways we stay connected to [abide in] Christ.</p>
            <p>The others are Prayer, Studying the Word, Worship,  Service, and Comforting others in their trials with the comfort God comforted  us with during our own trials.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>The life of a Christian is a shared  life. We are expected to help one another in both spiritual and material ways  when God leads us. Acts 2:42-46 says that the early Christians devoted themselves to fellowship. They just didn&rsquo;t have  fellowship; they devoted themselves to it. Fellowship was one of the  objectives for gathering together. </p>
            <p>The Apostle Paul said, &ldquo;You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to  indulge your sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.&rdquo; Galatians 5:13 </p>
            <p>One of the ways we serve one another is  to help each other grow in Christ.&nbsp; All  of us are works in progress who are growing to emulate Christ.&nbsp; In general, the church helps members grow in  Christ by providing many opportunities to learn the Word and to practice the  Word through service to others, and times of worship, fellowship, prayer, and  comfort. </p>
            <p>We&rsquo;re  familiar with most</p>
            <p>of those opportunities, but what about fellowship?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that all about?&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Fellowship is a lot like a friendship  relationship in a spiritual context. It means that we befriend others, who also  have a relationship with Christ, by submitting to each other in Christ (Eph.  5:21), helping one another grow spiritually (4:13-16), and sharing life &ndash; our  testimony, our victories and struggles, our  appointments and disappointments-our relationship with Jesus Christ. It means sharing our interests, goals,  feelings, experiences, and concerns. It means being partners who work together  and care for one another. </p>
            <p>We all, at times, need someone to lean  on. We need to bear one another&rsquo;s burdens. Galatians 6:2. But as we fellowship,  we need to always remember that these  &ldquo;spiritual friends&rdquo; only help us draw closer to Christ. They don&rsquo;t replace Him, who is the &ldquo;one mediator  between God and men&rdquo; 1 Tim. 2:5 </p>
            <p>We fellowship when we share how the Lord  is both our possessor and dispossessor (Isaiah 45: 5-8) as we surrender our  life to the One who is the Blessed Controller  of all things. We fellowship when we receive Christ from one another by  obeying His &ldquo;one another&rdquo; instructions. </p>
            <p>There are thirty &ldquo;one another&rdquo; scriptures in the New Testament. Here&rsquo;s a  sample.. </p>
            <p>Love one  another. Jn 15:17; 1 Peter 1:22</p>
            <p>Restore  one another in the spirit of meekness. Gal. 6:1</p>
            <p>Bear ye  one another&rsquo;s burdens. Gal. 6:2</p>
            <p>Serve one  another. Gal. 5:13</p>
            <p>Do not  envy or provoke one another. Gal. 5:25</p>
            <p>Submit  your selves one to another.&nbsp; Eph. 5:21</p>
            <p>Pray for  one another. Eph. 6:18</p>
            <p>Prefer one another. Rom. 12:10</p>
            <p>Forbearing one another and forgiving one another. Col. 3:13 </p>
            <p>Teach and  admonish one another.&nbsp; Col.3:16</p>
            <p>Comfort  one another. 2 Cor. 1:4; 1Thess. 4:18</p>
            <p>Exhort (encourage) and edify one  another.&nbsp; 1Thess. 5:11</p>
            <p>Greet one  another. 2 Thess. 5:26</p>
            <p>Receive  one another. Rom. 15:7</p>
            <p>Be  members of one another.&nbsp; Rom. 12:4</p>
            <p>Be devoted to one another&nbsp;  with brotherly love. Rom. 12:10</p>
            <p>Be tender-hearted one to another.  Eph. 4:32</p>
            <p>Lay down  your lives for one another. 1John 3:16</p>
            <p>Meet the  needs of one another. 1John 3:17</p>
            <p>In Our Daily Bread, Dave McCasland tells  about a group of people who share a strong bond of faith in Christ.&nbsp; One of them is a 93-year-old woman, who said  that she felt she could call any one in the group even at 2 am for any type of  assistance.&nbsp; Whether the need is prayer,  practical help, or someone to be there in time of need, these friends are  unconditionally committed to each other. </p>
            <p>We need to wonder if we&rsquo;re not missing  something in our Christian life if we&rsquo;re not part of a &ldquo;2 am group.&rdquo;&nbsp; Maybe we need to ask the Lord to bring us  into fellowship with at least one other person with whom we can share a  commitment to pray and care. </p>
            <p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve seen that belonging  to a small group of believers is a fantastic way to befriend other  Christians-to pray and care for them&ndash;and to pour my life into them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also a great way for visitors to a  church to get acquainted quickly with the brethren and learn about the church.</p>
            <p>These  groups can be home groups or groups that meet in church &ndash; like Sunday school  classes or men&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s, couples, or youth bible studies.&nbsp; These groups are also good to get more  personalized teaching. Generally, they are more informal than church  worship services, where God&rsquo;s Word is preached.&nbsp; Sermons are more inspirational. Bible studies and small fellowship  groups have different goals than sermons. These groups aim more at  information and education rather than inspiration. </p>
            <p>In small groups, question and answer  times are considered very important ways to learn and grow in Christ. It&rsquo;s also  a great place for meeting and fellowshipping with other church members; and a  place where people can pray more specifically for a person&rsquo;s need. </p>
            <p>In my experience, these groups are  normally moderated by men and women who are appointed by the church  leadership.&nbsp; Some can be strictly Bible  studies. Others may be strictly for fellowship. Some may be a combination of  the two. In all cases, they become fun and family-building times.</p>
            <p>Small groups are also a safe place to be because normally the church  oversees and guides them through the deacons who attend (either regularly or  occasionally). </p>
            <p>Have you asked anyone, &ldquo;Would you  fellowship with me?&rdquo;</p>
