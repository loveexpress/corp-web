            <h4 id="articleTitle">Jeremiah Lanphier - Legacy Celebrated</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Deborah Francisco </p>
            </div>
      <p ><em>If my people who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray, seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land. - 2 Chronicles 7:14 NIV.</em></p>
      
      <p>One hundred fifty years ago one man touched New York City through noontime prayer meetings, sparking a revival which spread across America and into other parts of the world.This man was Jeremiah Lanphier, a businessman who had a heart for people. Lanphier started his noon prayer meetings on Sept. 23, 1857 with six people in attendance. 40 people arrived for the second meeting and from there the numbers quickly reached the thousands, and hundreds thousands. The 150th Anniversary of Lanphier&rsquo;s noontime prayer meetings was commemorated through a conference held Sept. 21-23, 2007 at the Hilton. The conference also unveiled the sculpture, &ldquo;Invitation to Prayer,&rdquo; created by artist Lincoln Fox to honor the legacy of Jeremiah Lanphier.</p>
      <p>Headlining the conference were speakers <strong>Dr. Timothy Keller, Dr. Jack Hayford, Dr. Henry Blackaby, Dr. A. R. Bernard, Suzan Johnson Cook, Os Hillman, Ron Luce</strong> and many others. The events kicked off on Friday night with a dinner, and address from Dr. Keller, and the unveiling of Fox&rsquo;s sculpture.</p>
      <p>Saturday morning conference attendees gathered together for a time of worship and refreshment before Dr. Hayford and Dr. Blackaby spoke on issues of prayer. &ldquo;The God of revival addresses Himself to a very barren and despairing situation,&rdquo; Dr. Hayford proclaimed to the crowd. Hayford has a special message for the city declaring that, &ldquo;the wrestling for the city of New York and its environs, or our nation for that matter, will not be accomplished by effective programs and plans as the initiation point... the initiation point is first, the worshiping church and the presence of God gaining faith to become the praying, interceding church with confidence and power. And then the active church, reaching with love -- then those programs and systems God gives us.&rdquo; Hayford encouraged everyone with a call to worship, &ldquo;to enlarge the tent.&rdquo; Following his powerful address he had the crowd join in a time of prayer.</p>

        <div class="photocredits2">Jack Beckett</div>
        <img src="images/jackbeckett.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="125" /></div><p>A key person in instituting this event was Jack Beckett, chairman of R. W. Beckett Corporation. When Beckett first read the story of Jeremiah Lanphier, he was struck by the fact that Lanphier was a businessman. &ldquo;That caught my attention because the world in which I live is the world of business,&rdquo; Beckett said. &ldquo;My passion has been to try to connect the whole concept of mission with work.&rdquo; In fact, Beckett&rsquo;s concept was noticed by ABC when they ran a special on his company&rsquo;s unique philosophy in September 1995. The show had such a reaction that Beckett published the book, Loving Monday, on the issue. Beckett also played a big role in the creating of the &ldquo;Invitation to Prayer&rdquo; sculpture. The idea of making a sculpture to honor Lanphier&rsquo;s legacy came to Beckett through a conversation with Dr. Bill Bright, founder of Campus Crusade for Christ when Bright casually mentioned that there ought to be a statue in honor of Lanphier&rsquo;s amazing story. These words came back to Beckett when he was considering ways to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Fulton Street Revival. Lanphier is a beautiful example of how powerful prayer is. &ldquo;It was when he began to pray that things started to change,&rdquo; Beckett said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing story of how taking that burden, but giving it back to God in prayer, produced results that nobody, least of all he, could have possibly imagined.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>After conceiving the idea of a sculpture Beckett contacted artist, Lincoln Fox. Fox&rsquo;s sculptures have been displayed at the Smithsonian Institute, The Kennedy Galleries, the Albuquerque airport, and many galleries across the nation. Fox and Beckett met to discuss the concept. &ldquo;We want something that will keep the idea of Jeremiah alive for as long as we can,&rdquo; Fox said, explaining why they chose to do the piece in bronze. After much discussion on how to pose the sculpture, Fox invented the idea of having Lanphier seated on a park bench, welcoming passersby to join him there. &ldquo;In the process of experimenting with Jeremiah: different positions, different ideas, different expressions; I found a very beautiful sweet spot.&rdquo; Fox said. &ldquo;Just as you get close enough to Jeremiah to make a direct eye contact with him--suddenly something inside you starts to quicken as your spirit recognizes itself in the eyes of Jeremiah. Suddenly, you realize it&rsquo;s just the same spirit, and it makes things begin to happen.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The conference served as a way to remember how an amazing revival was started through the faithfulness of one man. The book, The New York City Prayer Meeting, written by Talbot W. Chambers gives a taste of Lanphier&rsquo;s character, stating that: [Lanphier] experienced frequent discouragements, and sometimes had his faith sorely tried and his hopes painfully frustrated...he was accustomed to spread out his sorrows before the Lord, and seek fresh supplies of grace and zeal by communion with Him who is invisible. Waiting upon the Lord, he renewed his strength; calling upon God, he was answered. His own soul was cheered and refreshed. (p. 34).</p>
      <p>The sculpture and the conference were a wonderful way to bring this story to the minds of Christians today. Revival is at the forefront of people&rsquo;s minds, especially people in the city. The conference featured several tracts during the day including church planting, AID&rsquo;s &amp; the church, compassion &amp; social justice, historical, marketplace, prayer and Youth. Featured in the youth track was TeenMania founder, Ron Luce. Luce has a vision to make revival in NYC a reality for many youths in the city. Luce has been working to bring BattleCry to the city. BattleCry is a youth rally to encourage youth to be passionate about following Christ. According to Luce it &ldquo;really is not just an event -- it&rsquo;s to wake up the churches in a mass way in that region. Let&rsquo;s go after kids, let&rsquo;s teach them, and disciple them.&rdquo; The event will be held at Continental Airlines Arena in February. Luce is passionate about raising up an army of youth to bring Christ to the nations. Luce became a Christian at age 16 when a friend dragged him to church and Luce heard the first sermon of his life that made sense. That day Luce committed his life to Christ saying that, &ldquo;when you fall in love with Jesus, you fall out of love with the world.&rdquo; Soon after this, Luce was kicked out of his father&rsquo;s house because his stepmom thought he was too much of a &ldquo;Jesus Freak.&rdquo; Luce&rsquo;s pastor took him in which revolutionized Luce&rsquo;s life. TeenMania really got started in 1986 when Luce began pursuing the vision God had given him to reach the youth of America. Luce is very excited about BattleCry coming to New York, and he has high hopes for the outcome of it. Luce hopes to get 2,000 churches in the area to double the size of their youth group in the next two years as a result of Battle Cry.
