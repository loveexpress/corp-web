      <p ><strong>The Storm is brewing. We are a united army of youth pastors, and congregations, and we are dreaming together, that the youth of the tri-state area will come aboard. The Youth Revival is happening all over the world. The youth in Egypt, Iran and other countries are arising to demand democracy. How much more will the youth of the gospel come up with creative strategies for outreaches that will connect with the youth around the world. I just attended the STORM and interviewed the leaders Ron Luce, Jamal Bernard and Adam Durso.</strong></p>
      <p ><strong>Edith Stranges:</strong> Have you done other STORM events in other states?</p>
      <p><strong>Ron Luce:</strong> We started in Dallas, Fort Worth and a few other places. We&rsquo;ve actually used this as a model to go with in figuring out - How can we do this in other places?</p>
      <p><strong>EMS:</strong> Where do you see this going in the future?</p>
      <p><strong>RL:</strong> What we&rsquo;ve talked about in the steering committee here is &lsquo;Our initial goal is to get 2500 churches and double the discipleship of the youth leadership groups, and that they be on fire and thriving. A lot of what&rsquo;s happening today both here in New York and in New Jersey is an effort to go forth. Let&rsquo;s not just have a big event; let&rsquo;s really train youth ministers so we can have thriving events in all these different churches.</p>
      <p><strong>EMS:</strong> Do you have access to listings of pastors who are on board?</p>
      <p><strong>RL:</strong> That&rsquo;s part of what today is all about because we&rsquo;re launching this whole vision called STORM where by at the end of the day, they&rsquo;re going to hear the whole vision, so they can be a part of this event.</p>
      <p><strong>EMS:</strong> How many churches do you have affiliated with this and how do you go about getting those pastors to get involved with the STORM?</p>
      <p><strong>Jamal Bernard:</strong> This started some four years ago and Rev. Adam Durso had reached out to me and from there shared from one pastor to another to another pastor and it was like a ripple effect. We come together for such an event like that of Teen Mania which has proven itself. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s really there and truly wants to see the local ministry built and it can happen when the entities are coming together. It happens when the pastors linking together are saying &lsquo;OK, we are all working together&rsquo; and Ron has become the catalyst, the spark plug to unite us and it all started with Adam Durso.</p>
      <p><strong>EMS:</strong> How many pastors do you have behind you?</p>
      <p><strong>Adam Durso:</strong> There&rsquo;s gotta be well over 500 or so that would certainly get together.</p>
      <p><strong>Ron Luce:</strong> I think about 500 or 600 actually brung their group to BattleCry and so really what we&rsquo;re doing with this whole STORM initiative is going to really formalize it. Rather than just bringing your kids to a group, be a part of a movement where we&rsquo;re seriously growing. Our youth ministries are bringing strength to our local youth ministries, and having ongoing quality ministries all year long, with training. Pastor Adam has done these Youth Pastors Fellowship for years in all the different boroughs and trying to encourage, bless, love, and pour life into the youth, but  we are still formalizing it more now. It&rsquo;s great to come, but it&rsquo;s really not enough. We&rsquo;re not going to change a generation if you just come to something like this.</p>
      <p><strong>EMS:</strong> Do you feel much resistance?</p>
      <p><strong>AD:</strong> No! I think the guys are open to it. I think they want it. I think that when they understand that the motives behind it are really genuine and they&rsquo;re built out of relationships. I was Jamal Bernard friend before I ever ask him to any kind of Youth Pastors meeting, and I think that friendship has extended beyond just the core guys to guys across the board. I think that the relationship with Ron is genuine, and I think that the relationships with other guys do feel it&rsquo;s genuine. You know New Yorkers can see through anything; New Yorkers, we see the citizens, and we see if it&rsquo;s a play, or if it&rsquo;s real. This is about relationships. This is about guys who genuinely have a common goal.</p>
      <p><strong>EMS:</strong> What about Long Island?</p>
      <p><strong>AD:</strong> In Long Island, many pastors are on board &shy;such  as Bishop Tony D&rsquo;Onofrio&rsquo;s son of Upper Room Ministries, Dix Hills, NY. When we held a Youth Pastor Fellowship, we had over seventy-five youth pastors just on Long Island (Nassau County). So the turnout out there has been huge. Again, when they feel it&rsquo;s birthed out of relational equity, they become involved.</p>
