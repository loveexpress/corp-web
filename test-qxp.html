 think that I have answered the end of my crea&shy;tion.&rdquo;<br>

            <span class="text2">	Yet, declaring independence was only the beginn&shy;ing. Much sacrifice, patience and reliance on God would still be required. As
 signer of the declaration, Abraham Clark explained:&ldquo;This seems now to begin a trying season; but that indulgent Father who hath
 hitherto pre- served us will, I trust, appear for our help, and prevent our
 being crushed; if otherwise, His will be done.&rdquo;<br>

 liberties came only through great, personal sacrifice: Nine of the 56 signers of the declaration died during the war. Five were captured by the British and tortured before
 their deaths. Twelve had their homes destroyed by British troops, and three
 lost their sons to the enemy. Such sa&shy;crifices remind us that liberty is never free-every generation must defend it
 anew.

 was made clear in a letter from Dr. Benjamin Rush to John Adams after
 witnessing the celebration surrounding America&rsquo;s 35th&nbsp;birthday in 1811. Dr. Rush told Mr. Adams:

 particularly one of them, ran away with all the glory of the day. But scarcely
 a word was said of the solicitude and labors and fears and sorrows and sleepless nights of the men who projected, proposed, defen&shy;ded, and subscribed [signed] the Declaration of Independence. Do you recollect
 your memorable speech upon the day on which the vote was ta&shy;ken? Do you recollect the pensive and awful silence which pervaded the House

            <span class="text2">	While we should remember the sacrifices, it is more important that we remember
 the proper manner to celebrate the Fourth of July. What is the proper manner? The answer was given in a letter John Adams wrote to
 Abigail on the day they approved the declaration. He forecast: &ldquo;I am apt to believe that [this day] will be celebrated by succeeding generations
 as the &lsquo;Day of Deliverance&rsquo; by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty!&rdquo;<br>
