      <p >The gunman Matthew Murray who opened fire at New Life Church at Colorado Springs, Colorado and at YWAM Training Center 12 hours earlier, posting an anti-christian message online Sunday, the day of the shooting, in a language almost identical to the text of a manifesto written by one of the Columbine killers.</p>
      <p>Minnesota native &amp; former police officer <strong>Jeanne Assam</strong> was hailed a hero on Monday for intervening in the shootings at New Life Church in Colorado Springs.</p>
      <p>&quot;God guided me and protected me,&quot; she said. &quot;I was given the assignment to end this before it got too much worse. I give the credit to God. God was with me. I didn't think for a minute to run away.&quot;</p>
      <p>According to a report on Denver's Channel 7 News, Assam said she believes God gave her the strength to confront Matthew Murray, keeping her calm and focused even though he appeared to be twice her size and was more heavily armed.</p>
      <p>&quot;It seemed like it was me, the gunman and God,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p>In front of thousands of viewers she testifies of the power of the Holy Spirit. She confronted the heavily armed gunman, telling him to lay down his weapons. Her hands weren't even shaking. When he did not comply, she did what she had to do.</p>
      <p>&quot;You Christians brought this on yourselves,&quot; Murray wrote, according to KUSA-TV in Denver. &quot;Feel no remorse, no sense of shame, I don't care if I live or die in the shoot-out. All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you ... as I can especially Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world.&quot;</p>
      <p>Murray came from what neighbors have described as a &quot;very, very religious&quot; family. His 21year old brother, Christopher, is a student at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., and Murray attended a home-based computer school and had worked at his computer for three to five hours a day for the past two years, investigators said.</p>
      <p>In 2002, Murray had enrolled in a Discipleship Training School (DTS) at the YWAM Arvada training center. DTS students partake in a 12-week lecture course followed by a 12-week field assignment, usually to another culture. Murray neither completed the lecture phase nor participated in the field assignment. YWAM's USA Int'l President John Dawson said program directors felt &quot;issues with Murray's health made it inappropriate&quot; for him to participate.</p>
      <p>Richard Werner, Murray's former roommate at the training center, described Murray as a quiet and sarcastic person who made some bizarre comments. At a YWAM Christmas festival in December 2002, Werner recalled Murray playing Marilyn Manson's &quot;Sweet Dreams (are Made of This)&quot; and Linkin Park's &quot;One Step Closer&quot; which included the lyrics &quot;Cause I'm one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;A lot of the kids really got scared about it,&quot; Werner told CNN. &quot;We were just playing songs about Christmas, about God and friendship and then he came up with those songs.&quot;</p>
      <p>Murray's parents were there and with the center's officials, they decided it would be best for him not to go out on a mission, according to CNN. Murray did not react angrily but was &quot;always very calm,&quot; said Wer&shy;ner.</p>
      <p>&quot;After that, he got out of the meeting and he turned to a friend of mine and the only thing he said was like 'I have a message for everyone: just say that now you will see your star,'&quot; Werner told CNN.</p>
      <p>He had, however, been sending hate mail to the center, police said in court papers Monday.</p>
      <p>&quot;Our family cannot express the magnitude of our grief for the victims and families of this tragedy. On behalf of our family, and our son, we ask for forgiveness. We cannot understand why this has happened,&quot; Murray's uncle, Phil Abeyta, said in a statement as he fought back tears, according to The Associated Press.</p>
      <p>While news about the Arvada shooting had prompted New Life to beef up security that day, the 10,000-member church- the largest in the state - had always kept security volunteers at the church. Senior Pastor Brady Boyd explained that in a culture that has become more open, churches have increasingly become targets of people who are &quot;aggravated and upset.&quot;</p>
      <p>Megachurches across the country are taking more precautions as violence is on the rise against religious groups and churches, some of which open their doors daily. Earlier this year, megachurch pastor Bishop T. D. Jakes held his third annual S.T.O.P.P.E.D. - Security Training Offering Procedure Protection Education and Direction - conference, urging safety.</p>
