            </div>
      <p >We hear the commercials, listen to her show on WTHE 1520 and see her advertisement in this paper&hellip; A pillar in her community, a women of integrity, a motivator to others, a car sales machine, a mother, a friend--but most of all a child of God! The Queen of Cars, Cynthia D. Boone is BACK! All praise and glory belongs to God. It was a normal Thursday evening for Cynthia; she recently celebrated the HS graduation of her beloved son JerVaughn and was at a rehearsal supporting him as well as his &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; Charles and Darnell. Just after finishing a rehearsal on her way home Cynthia&rsquo;s life would change forever in the blink of an eye. Cynthia passed out and an ambulance was called. After being treated at the hospital Cynthia is advised that her condition was an &ldquo;episode&rdquo; and she needed to rest. Still not feeling her normal self Cynthia returned home to rest and within a couple of hours she had to be rushed back to the hospital. The devil wasn&rsquo;t going to give up that easily. Recently, Cynthia had celebrated major milestones in life such as her son&rsquo;s graduation and even more spiritually related she delivered her initial sermon at her church, Living Faith Ministries under the tutelage of Pastor Rasheen C. Rutledge  just two weeks before. It would be just like the devil to want to test our faith when we are doing the work of the Lord. Cynthia has lost feeling in the left side of her body. Her hand and leg were numb and her speech was impaired. It was after several days of testing, the doctors denoted that she had a stroke. It was expressed that she would have difficulty with speech and it would take extensive physical therapy to gain mobility. How many know that the doctor&rsquo;s prognosis is not always God&rsquo;s diagnosis? Cynthia would not accept what the doctor&rsquo;s said. Every hour of every day she would speak, read scriptures out-loud and pray that God would restore her. Well surprisingly to the doctors, Cynthia&rsquo;s speech returned within days and then she began to have feeling in her left hand and leg. God was making a miracle before their eyes. God gave her an encore and did it again!</p>
      <p>With much prayer and the exercising of her faith Cynthia was soon released from the hospital and moved to a rehabilitation center. It was with the help of her friends, church family, her dad Missionary Arthur Boone, and her son Jay and affectionately known as &quot;The Guys&quot; Darnell and Charles and also her sis in christ Kelly Goudy Mitchell, that Cynthia was moved to an advance physical therapy facility in Long Island (The Mayfair Rehabilitation Center) It was in rehabilitation that Cynthia&rsquo;s ministry was expanded because it was her faith that was a motivation to others in the center as well as the staff. Taking it day by day Cynthia went from the bed to the wheelchair, to a walker and now a cane.</p>
      <p>Cynthia was informed that she would not regain 100% of her mobility in her left hand or foot but she is BACK! She is back driving! She is back to work! She is back in church! She is back singing with the Timothy Wright Memorial Choir! and also She is back on the radio! The Queen of Cars is BACK! By the exercising of her faith Cynthia is a walking miracle. For many who had a stroke they would not have recovered as much as Cynthia has. God gets all the glory and honor for restoring Cynthia. So, the next time you see Cynthia take a second look because you are looking at God&rsquo;s miracle.</p>
