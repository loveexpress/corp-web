      <p >        The accounts of the prophets hold many stories that often times are overlooked. First, because some accounts are difficult to understand and second because people usually find it hard to make connections with these stories and everyday life. This year I have found myself in the book of Jeremiah many a time and I believe that the words written here will encourage, bless and even convict your heart as we approach the New Year desiring a new way for our personal lives and our ministries.</p>
      <p>Jeremiah, a young teen, receives the call of God to be a prophet to the nations at a time when sin abounded to the utmost. Jerusalem was in a sorry state and history will show that during these moments prophets would rise to speak of impending discipline from God and his undying love for His people. Jeremiah was called to the same purposes but his reply was like many of ours.</p>
      <p>God says to Jeremiah, <em>&ldquo;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations&rdquo;</em> (Jer. 1:5 NIV). God clearly speaks to Jeremiah and declares that the plan He had for his life began when Jeremiah was formed at birth. Jeremiah was created for this very purpose to be a prophet to the nations. Let me add that God still speaks today like He did years ago - one word from Him can change the entire trajectory of the rest of your life! Others may have called you a mistake but God birthed you with purpose and if you&rsquo;re breathing today know that God has a work for you to do that will advance His kingdom and bring Him glory.</p>
      <p>But like us Jeremiah replies as such, <em>&ldquo;Ah, Sovereign Lord... I do not know how to speak; I am only a child&rdquo;</em> (Jer. 1:6 NIV). Quickly Jeremiah points out his weaknesses due to fear and insecurity. He didn&rsquo;t believe he could accomplish what God had created him to do - to be His mouth piece. Excuses do not trigger the power of God - your &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; does. That trust in Him and His capability is what moves His hand to action. <strong>Remember, where your human strength ends God&rsquo;s power begins. </strong></p>
      <p>Still God recognized Jeremiah&rsquo;s fear and said to Him, <em>&ldquo;Do not say, &lsquo;I am only a child.&rsquo; You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,&rdquo;</em> declares the Lord (Jer. 1:7-8 NIV). The Lord comforted Jeremiah in his fear and also promised that He would not leave him alone or without what He needed to fulfill his call -His authoritative word. <em>&ldquo;Then the Lord reached out His hand and touched my mouth and said &lsquo;Now I have put my words in your mouth&rdquo;</em> (Jer. 1:9 NIV). The Lord had provided all Jeremiah needed in one touch. This reminds us that when we can&rsquo;t, God can and will if we trust Him. In order for God to get the glory, He must position us outside of our comfort zones - &ldquo;smack dab&rdquo; in the midst of our weaknesses.</p>
      <p>The Lord&rsquo;s task for Jeremiah and I believe for us corporately today is this - <em>&ldquo;to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant&rdquo;</em> (Jer. 1:10 NIV). God&rsquo;s heart for you as an individual in this New Year is to build you up, to plant you and to see you flourish so that it will bring Him glory and expand His kingdom. But before He can build and plant in your life there are things that He must first uproot, tear down, destroy and overthrow.</p>
      <p>The theory of relativity declares that no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time. Similarly in your life, your heart, mind and desires cannot be simultaneously occupied and owned by the Lord and sin and compromise. You must uproot the things that are lodged in your heart and may have been planted there from previous generations. You must tear down every thought that is in opposition to what God says about you by taking every thought captive in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you must completely destroy the areas of compromise. It was never a walled city, a raging river at flood stage or a nine foot tall giant that kept the people of God from their destiny - it was compromise. Destroy the things that have held you back in the past!</p>
      <p>Lastly it is imperative that you overthrow whoever is sitting on the throne of your heart. There could only be one Lord and one King. You and God cannot occupy the same throne. In every new level with God there is a new place of consecration because God will not build His kingdom on top of our secular foundation.</p>
      <p>Today, uproot and tear down, destroy and overthrow so that God can build and plant something even greater in you for 2011!</p>
