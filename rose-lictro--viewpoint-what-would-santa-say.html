            </h4>
              <div id="authorname"><!--SECTION LEFT END--><strong>By Rose Acker Lictro </strong></div>
              
              <p>The legend of jolly old St. Nick, began with a real person:  Nicholas, a Chr-istian who lived in the 4th century. Very little is known about&nbsp; Nic-holas, except he was the bishop of the  church of Myra, a city on the southern coast of Asia Minor. Tradition says he  was put in prison because of his faith but was later released. St. Nicholas  reputation for generosity and  compassion&nbsp; has come to exemplify the spirit of giving at Christmas time. </p>
              <p>His  transformation into Santa Claus began in Germany among Protestant chu-rches  where he was called Kriss Kringle, derived from Christ kindle, which means  Christ child. Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam introduced the legend to America.  They knew him as Sinter Klaas. Our modern day conception of Santa and the myth  surrounding the red suit, reindeer, sleigh and portly size originated in the  1800&rsquo;s here in America through the stories of Washington Irving, the cartoons  of Thomas Nast and the poem by Clement Moore, which begins, &ldquo;Twas the night  before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not  even a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Let&rsquo;s reflect  on what Bishop Nicholas might tell us if he were here today as we ask the  question, <strong>&ldquo;What Would Santa Say&rdquo; </strong>to  us about how we celebrate Christmas?</p>
              <p>He might tell  us to examine a few things like <strong>taking a  look at our focus</strong>. Although you won&rsquo;t find him prominently displayed amidst  all the holiday d&eacute;cor in many stores you visit during the &lsquo;season to be jolly&rsquo;  the focus of the holiday isn&rsquo;t on Jesus. Santa might point us to <strong>Isaiah 7:14: &ldquo;Therefore the Lord himself  will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and  will call him Immanuel.&rdquo;</strong></p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s just a guess but I think Santa might also say to us: <strong>take a look at your faith.</strong></p>
              <p>Some people work pretty hard at making Santa seem real to  their children so that they will believe in him-do we make it easier for them  to believe in Jesus Christ through the faith they see in us?</p>
              <p>Our children  can learn so much about trusting Christ by the way they see us do it.<strong>1 Peter 1:8 Though you have not seen him,  you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and  are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy.&rdquo;</strong></p>
              <p>Again, I am  just wondering, but maybe Santa would say<strong> take a look at your giving. </strong>A substantial portion of our&nbsp; holiday gift-giving occurs as an exchange. We  give presents to others that also give presents to us. A truly sacrificial gift  is something given to someone who cannot give back anything in return. Some of  the best gifts are the ones that no one knows&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you gave except yourself and those given  to people who have nothing at all. Santa might point us to <strong>Acts 20:35:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&ldquo;In everything I did, I  showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering  the words the Lord himself said: &lsquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&rdquo;</strong></p>
              <p>Santa might  tell us, take a look at your focus, he might say take a look at your faith,  maybe he&rsquo;d say take a look at your giving, but I can also imagine him telling  us, if you want to best celebrate Christmas, <strong>take a look at your love. </strong>Santa might tell us, &ldquo;When you love me,  your love costs you nothing. You&rsquo;ve turned me into someone who can give you  anything, yet asks you for nothing in return.<strong>&rdquo; Love is costly. </strong>The Bible reveals a link between love and  obedience.. Santa might point us to <strong>1  John 5:3-4:&ldquo;This is the love for God: to obey his commands. And his commands  are not burdensome, for everyone born of God overcomes the world.&rdquo;</strong></p>
              <p>St. Nicholas would have pointed us to Jesus Christ, and  said something like this:<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>&rdquo;Look to the manger, not the mantle, see the Savior, not the  sleigh, find the redeemer, not the reindeer</strong></p>
              <p><strong>the one lying in the hay...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Try prayer instead of wish lists. Give thanks to God above!  Try holiness and sacrificial love...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Worry more about your lifestyle, than your stocking full of  gold, confess your sins to Jesus and he will make you whole! </strong></p>
              <p>This is one of  the most wonderful times of the year; regardless of what gift you give or  receive, I want everyone to know that there is a gift that we can all unwrap  everyday of our lives -<strong>Jesus is The Gift  That Takes a lifetime to Unwrap.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>&ldquo;Thanks be to God for His  indescribable gift.&rdquo; (1 Cor 9:15)</strong></p>
