      <p>The Child Sex Trafficking problem is increasing in the US. Girls are being stolen and put into sex slavery. <a href="http://WWW.STCNOW.ORG">WWW.STCNOW.ORG</a> hires retired military operatives with training to track predators&rsquo; to get convictions to stop the demand side of this industry.<br />

      <p>I was 15 Years old in Detroit, MI, from an upper class family. My father was a professional and my mom stayed at home. I was targeted by a group of men who had a plan.</p>
      <p>One day a boy asked me if I wanted a ride home from school. I went with him, but flags went off. He took me to his house saying he had to pick some things up and asked me to come in. I said I shouldn&rsquo;t, but he said I go to Church with you. I went inside where he drugged and raped me. I was a virgin, I was devastated. I was brought up to be a virgin when I got married.</p>
      <p>The next week the boy told me he had cousins in the next room and showed me pictures of the rape. He told me I had to &ldquo;earn&rdquo; them back. I thought they wanted me to clean their house or do homework.</p>
      <p>He told me it would be explained later, but these people were dangerous and if I didn&rsquo;t do what they wanted, they were going to show the pictures to my parents, his boss, at school, and to everyone in church. I didn&rsquo;t tell my parents, but young girls who are raped should absolutely tell their parents.</p>
      <p>They started calling my house in the middle of the night; I had my own phone in my room and they would demand I meet them immediately. I would sneak out without make-up or doing my hair, and usually in my pajamas. A car picked me up and took me to someone&rsquo;s residence, usually in a finished basement. The clients were waiting there.</p>
      <p>When they were finished they dropped me off, reminding me of the pictures. On the worst night, six men drove me to a horrible Detroit inner city motel with a few dozen men waiting. They sold me to the highest bidder one by one. I was left there, passed out, alone, no ID, no money, no shoes.</p>
      <p>For the entire two years people would notice something was different about me. There were older men around me, but no one said anything. The teachers at school noticed I was being harassed by these boys, but did nothing. But then once, at 4am at a motel, a waitress noticed I was traumatized and spoke to me and called the police.</p>
      <p class="qa">Theresa Flores&rsquo; 
        Redemption</p>
      <p>The thing that took me out of this was prayer. I never lost my faith in God. These men took my body, my mind, my security, my self-worth, but I would not let them take my faith and my relationship with God. God is the ONLY Reason I survived! And He helped me change a horrific part of my life into a mission to save others from experiencing the same thing.</p>
      <p>The demand is so great out there and these guys will do anything to get the money associated with it. If we can change the culture so the average &ldquo;Joe Buyer&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t want to take the risk, the demand will drop. To help drop this demand, I started <a href="http://www.Traffickfree.com">www.Traffickfree.com</a> and wrote a book call &ldquo;The Sacred Bath.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Be observant and attentive of what your kids are doing. Check on them in the middle on they night. Make sure you have the home phone numbers of all their friends. If you see any unusual activity, perhaps a young girl with older men, report it to the police.</p>
      <p>I realized I am not the only person that this happens to. This is common and I realized I could not stay silent. This is my story of overcoming and redemption.</p>
      <p>Stop Child Trafficking Now believes strongly that to eliminate this heinous crime the demand for children must end. That's why SCT Now seeks to destroy the source. SCTNow believes that by putting predators behind bars we can Stop Child Trafficking Now.</p>
