            <h4>Follow The Star</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Rev. Dr. Clifton L. 
              Mullings</p>

            <p><span class="qa">Matthew Chapter 5</span><br />
              <strong>Jesus Was Born In Bethlehem of Judaea</strong></p>
            <p>This was David&rsquo;s home town. The name means House of Bread - <br>
              A very ap&shy;propriate location for the Bread of Life to be born.</p>
            <p><strong>Wise Men Came From The East</strong></p>
            <p>The wise men were magi&rsquo;s the greek magoi the same word occurs in Acts 13:8, where it is translated sorcerer, but these men were not crafty magicians they were considered good and wise. Some scholars believe that the wise men came from Arabia just east of Palestine but it is more likely the general region of Metroptosia.</p>
            <p><strong>Where is He that is Born King of The Jews Matt 2:2</strong></p>
            <p>This is the first question in the New Testament; this is man searching for God. While the first question in the Old Testament in Genesis 3:9 &ldquo;Where are thou&rdquo; is God searching for man.</p>
            <p><strong>We Have Seen The Star In The East</strong></p>
            <p>The birth of Christ was notified to the Jewish Shepherds by an angel and to the gentile Philosophers by a star. The star was a supernatural phenomenon. Christ is our leader and example the star that we should follow. If we follow Christ who is our brilliant example we will have wholeness and fulfillment and prosperity and victory. The Apostle Paul said in 2 Cor 2:14 &ldquo;Thanks be to God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>We are come to Worship Him Matt 2:2,11</strong></p>
            <p>Christmas is a time of worship and adoration. Some call it Xmas without Christ there is no Christmas; Some people celebrate Christmas in partying, reveling in wantonness, drinking getting drunk claiming they are enjoying themselves. For the merchants Christmas is a time for sales and commerce, for thieves it is a time for aggravated assault and robbery, for the greedy it&rsquo;s a time to receive but for a child of God it is a time of good will and peace to all men. We will not have peace without the Prince of Peace.</p>
            <p><strong>Herod was troubled and all Jerusalem with him Matt 2:2</strong></p>
            <p>Herod feared that this new born King would be a threat to his throne. He told the wise men of his desire to come and worship him, but his intention was to assassinate him. The earthly King of the Jews sought to kill the one who was to be born the King of the Jews. The greatest wickedness often conceals itself under a mask of religion.</p>
            <p><strong>The Wise men presented their gifts</strong></p>
            <p>Gold, frankincense and myrrh. Gold: as a King they paid tribute. Frankincense: they honored Him with smoke of incense. Myrrh: he was destined to die for myrrh was used in embalming dead bodies.</p>
            <p><strong>The Angel gave divine direction to Mary &amp; Joseph. Matthew 2:2</strong></p>
            <p>God preserves purpose and his purposes and plans will be fulfilled. The gates of hell cannot prevail against his church.</p>
            <p><strong>They Are dead which sought the young childs life.</strong></p>
            <p>Satan has a plan to distract, detour, deceive and destroy but God has a plan that we can serve him with delight, determination, dedication and distinction.</p>
            <p><strong>Which Star Are You Following</strong></p>
            <p>When Jesus was born, the angels herald his birth and said, <em>&ldquo;fear not.</em>&rdquo; In this time of economic melt down, moral decay, political instability, global epidemic, hopelessness, insecurity, emotional and social trauma, depression, religious conflict, massive job cuts and desperations, we can still rejoice in the Christ of Christmas. We should embrace the past with thanksgiving, we are trustees of the present and architects of the future.</p>
            <p><em>For unto you is born this day in the City of David</em> means he is from the Messianic lineage.<em> A Savior</em> means he is a Redeemer Christ <em>&ldquo;Anointed The Lord&rdquo;</em> He is Sovereign. When following the star our lives should reflect his beauty and image. The first thing that God gave man is <em>&ldquo;Image&rdquo;</em> which in Hebrew means character Gen. 1:26</p>
            <p>The Church is a Great Big Moon That Must Reflect the Light Of Its Sun In A Dark Sin Curse World.</p>
            <p><strong>The Bible uses seven figures to depict our christian influence &amp; responsibility.</strong></p>
            <p>Salt preserving - Matt 5:13; Light Illuminating -Matt 5:14; Witnessess Testifying - Isaiah 43:10; Branches bearing fruit - John 15:5; Epistles Instructing - 2 Cor 3:2; Stewards Distributing - 1 Peter 4:10; Ambassadors Representing - 2 Cor 5:20</p>
