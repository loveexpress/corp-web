            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Jim Biscardi Jr. </p>
            </div>
            
            <p align="center"><em>&ldquo;For you know perfectly that the day of the  Lord so co&shy;meth as a thief in the night.&rdquo; 1Thessalonians 5:</em>2</p>
            
            
            <p>If we knew  that a thief would be coming to break into our home, we would develop the  discipline to lock all the doors and windows (especially when we&rsquo;re not sure of  the exact day). Similarly, we need to prepare for the Lord&rsquo;s return by being  disciplined in our spiritual life. Remember, our body is the temple of the Holy  Spirit. We are a spiritual house, and we need to secure it by abiding in  Christ.&nbsp; John 15:5</p>
            <p>The disciplined Christian life is like  riding a bicycle. The rim of the wheel is the Christian life. The hub is  Christ.We connect the Christian life to the hub [Christ] by spokes. These spokes cause us to &ldquo;abide in  Christ&rdquo;, to stay connected to Him. The spokes  represent race course markers (like street signs for the New York  marathon) we use to stay on course. They also represent the spiritual vitamins  God has given to us to help us run the race of life with His strength. We  should be regularly partaking of these spiritual vitamins as prescribed in  God&rsquo;s Word, keeping them in balance as directed by the Great Physician:</p>
            <p><strong>&bull;</strong> Vitamin  A (Ask) <strong>Prayer</strong> &ndash; Ephesians 6:18</p>
            <p><strong>&bull;</strong> Vitamin B (Bible) <strong>Study the Word</strong> &ndash;  2Timothy 2:15</p>
            <p><strong>&bull;</strong> Vitamin C (Comfort) others in their <strong>Trials  &amp; Suffering</strong> with the comfort God gave us in our own trials &ndash; 2  Corinthians 1:4. Trials are not in our control.&nbsp;  We trust God to provide whatever He deems appropriate.</p>
            <p><strong>&bull;</strong> Vitamin D (Do) <strong>Service</strong> &ndash; Matthew  25:14-30, Romans 12, and&nbsp; 1Corinthians 12</p>
            <p><strong>&bull;</strong> Vitamin E (Exalt) <strong>Worship</strong> &ndash; Psalm  100:4</p>
            <p><strong>&bull;</strong> Vitamin K (Koinonia is a Greek word for fellowship) <strong>Fellowship</strong> &ndash; Acts 2:42-47.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>We need to  keep them in balance because if one or two spokes are longer than  the others, it creates a bum&shy;py ride for us. And if the spokes are too small,  we have to pump very hard to cover just a small distance. We also need to have  periods of rest and renewal. Mark 6:31.</p>
            <p>These course markers and vitamins are  what God uses to transform our lives into Christ&rsquo;s image by renewing our minds.  Romans 12: 1-2 says, <em>&ldquo;Therefore, I urge  you, brothers, in view of God&rsquo;s mercy, to offer yourselves as living  sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God &ndash; which is your spiritual worship. Do not  conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the  renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God&rsquo;s  will is &ndash; His good, pleasing, and perfect will.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p> <strong>WORSHIP</strong> to tell Him how much we love Him and how much  we appreciate His work in our lives &ndash; to realize and enjoy being in His  presence &ndash; to remind ourselves who He is and who we are in Christ. Worshipping  the Lord reminds us that we fall way short of His greatness, and minimizes the  differences we sometimes imagine between ourselves and other believers. So  worship promotes unity in the Body of Christ. John 17:21.</p>
            <p>Worship Him as  the Lord and the One we serve. Enjoy His great love and  acceptance of us as He shapes us into what He wants us to be. Remember, God loves us as we are, but He  doesn&rsquo;t want us to stay that way. He wants to shape us into the image of His  Son.</p>
            <p>We <strong>FELLOWSHIP</strong> in Christ when we lovingly submit to each other (Ephesians 5:21), are accountable to one another, and  share our lives with one another &ndash; our testimony,  our victories and struggles, our appointments and disappointments - our  relationship with Jesus Christ. We fellowship when we share how our Lord is  both our &ldquo;Giver&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taker&rdquo; as we surrender our life to Him. We fellowship  when we receive Christ from one another by obeying His &ldquo;one another&rdquo;  instructions: John 15:17; Galatians 5:13,25; 6:1,2; Ephesians 4:32; 5:21; 6:18;  Romans 12:4,10,16; 15:7; Philippians 2:3; Colossians 3:1,16 and others.</p>
            <p> <strong>SURRENDER  FOR SERVICE</strong> to allow Him to use us for His glory and for honoring His name  &ndash; to let Him bless us as a vessel He works  through as fathers and husbands, mothers and wives, church leaders,  workplace leaders, and believers fulfilling the Great Commission &ndash; to develop a  heart in us for serving others (Luke 12:35) &ndash; to develop hearts in others we  disciple for serving like He&rsquo;s developed in us.</p>
            <p>Jesus gave us a pattern we should use  when we <strong>PRAY</strong>. Matthew 6: 9-15.&nbsp; Approach Him as Father, respecting and  revering Him. Ask Him to use our spiritual gifts to help build up His kingdom  on earth; to meet our daily needs; to help us forgive others and to overcome  temptation. No matter what happens, He is God Al&shy;mighty, and worthy of our  praise forever and ever. He also told us that we should not pray in order to  get recognized by man. But rather to enter our prayer closets where God alone  hears and answers our prayers. He also cautioned  us not to be repetitious, because our Father knows our requests before we ask.</p>
            <p>2 Corinthians 1: 3-5 explains what God  does in us with the <strong>TRIALS AND SUFFERING</strong> we experience: &ldquo;Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the  Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our  troubles, so we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves  have received from God.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The <strong>WORD  OF GOD</strong> was written over a period of 1600 years by 40 different authors who  wrote 66 books. Yet from Genesis to Revelation, this Book tells a consistent, unified story. The human writers were  not afraid to acknowledge that what they wrote and spoke was given to them by  God. Exodus 34: 27, Acts 3: 18, 21, and Hebrews 1:1.</p>
            <p>God&rsquo;s Word is a lamp unto our feet and a  light unto our path. Psalm 119: 105. To me  that means that His Word can help us moment by moment (the lamp) and  also to do long-term planning (the light). There are many other reasons for  disciplining our lives to study the Word of God: To ensure salvation. 2 Timothy  3:15; To obtain hope. Romans 15:4; To avoid deception.&nbsp; Proverbs 28:26; Ephesians 5:6; To obtain  faith. Romans 10:17; To obtain answers to prayer. John 15:7; To avoid sin.  Psalm 119:11; To understand God&rsquo;s will for our lives; Romans 12:2; and much  more.</p>
            <p>So let&rsquo;s discipline our lives to  faithfully follow the road markers that keep us on course and lead to meeting  the Lord in the air when He comes.            </p>
