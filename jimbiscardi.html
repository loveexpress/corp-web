            <h4>Timeless Leadership that Revives and Transforms - Part 1</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Jim Biscardi Jr. </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Servant  leadership is something that the world needs  now more than ever. Saying it another way: What the world needs now is  love &ndash; not the love that is flaunted by Hollywood or loosely thrown around in  political speeches &ndash; but the love demonstrated by Jesus Christ. Instead of  leadership that serves itself, we need leaders who visualize themselves as  servants to those who are given to them.</p>
            <p>Because we have the Holy Spirit within,  we have the power to be the leaders Jesus showed us how to be &ndash; leaders who  revive and transform our most important enterprises &ndash; and ultimately change the  world.</p>
            <p>As Christ&rsquo;s  leaders in our home, work, church and as ambassadors of Christ, we  need to be good listeners; be faithful and  build faithfulness; build up and encourage others; openly communicate  with our people and involve them in planning; build unity and family; recognize  and reward good conduct - not take the easy  road of rewarding or not rewarding everyone; give honest feedback by  speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15); rate performance with understanding; and develop a servant&rsquo;s &ldquo;heart&rdquo;in  others (John 13:14-17).</p>
            <p>These behaviors flow from us naturally  if we put a priority on preferring others over ourselves (Matthew 23:11); being  heart-to-heart &ndash; taking time to know others and to be known by them (John  10:14); taking action with pure motives and wisdom (James 3:17); and drawing people rather than &ldquo;push- ing&rdquo;  [manipulating] them (Matthew 11:28).</p>
            <p>Here  are a few of the effects that this kind of loving leadership would have on our  homes and&nbsp; churches just through good  listening, being faithful and building faithfulness, building up and  encouraging our people. Visualize the church and home to be like this:</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Good Listening</strong> <strong>in the Church</strong></p>
            <p>Pastor has an  open door policy. Prayer requests are solicited using leaflets  in the pews or through an email prayer chain.  Suggestions are requested for Sunday  school, children&rsquo;s church, Wednesday/Sunday services, and other  outreaches. Speakers are often requested by  church members. Pastor and other leaders conduct meetings as  facilitators and coaches to determine the mind of the Spirit through their  people, rather than dictating answers or manipulating to get preconceived  results. The board of trustees (or overseeing body of the church) and the  pastor work cooperatively with each other and are open to one another&rsquo;s ideas  and opinions.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Good Listening</strong> <strong>in the Home</strong></p>
            <p>Parents foster creativity in children by  stimulating imagination with games, stories, videos, music, toys, drawing, etc.  Parents ask children what they would do in various situations. If the parent  decides a different course of action, the child is told why. Parents look for  opportunities to do things suggested by the child. Husbands and wives are open  to each other&rsquo;s suggestions and promptings.  They see themselves as equals with different roles, each having ideas that  complement the other&rsquo;s.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Being Faithful and</strong> <strong>Building Faithfulness</strong> <strong>in the Church</strong></p>
            <p>Church leaders serve the members by  lovingly coaching them through leadership,  evangelism, teaching, counseling, parenting, work life, and other  programs to make them better. Leaders put members&rsquo; interests and priorities  before themselves. Church policies are not  made for the purpose of restricting the &ldquo;abuser minority&rdquo; but ra&shy;ther to  benefit, enhance, and encourage the majority of church members. There is an active leader visitation program to  church member homes. They are visited at home or in the hospital when sick. Also, telephone contact, fellowship  programs, and home Bible studies are used by church leaders to show their care  for church members. Church leaders are proactive and waste no time in  correcting, disciplining or counseling those who bring false teaching, immoral  or abusive behavior into the church or into its families.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Being Faithful and</strong> <strong>Building Faithfulness</strong> <strong>in the Home</strong></p>
            <p>Parents do not allow children to go  undisciplined for improper behavior. They are careful not to favor one child  over another in this area. Parents are proactive in protecting their children  against any corrupt, immoral or abusive behavior entering their lives from any  source. Husbands and wives also protect and  warn one another in each of these areas. Parents recognize real  accomplishments and reward their children equally. Husbands and wives put each  other&rsquo;s interests and priorities ahead of their own. They sacrifice for one  another. Husbands provide financial security and affection to their wives.  Wives provide admiration and good home-keeping for their husbands.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Building Up and Encouraging in the Church</strong></p>
            <p>The  overall church leadership model is one of servant-leader not micro mana- ger or  fear manager. Trust - between leaders and church members - inspires active  participation by the majority. Arm-twisting is not needed. Leaders lovingly  take members through stages (direction, coaching, encourage- ment) leading to  empowering them for making decisions, actively participating in church  activities, and for representing the church. Deacons (or other &ldquo;officials&rdquo;) are  truly elected from among the current church members by other members with  little or no &ldquo;filtering out&rdquo; by the current Board or the Pastor.</p>
            <p align="center"><strong>Building Up and</strong> <strong>Encouraging in the Home</strong></p>
            <p>Parents correct their children in a way  that says &ldquo;I love you and want you to know right from wrong.&rdquo; Parents are under  control when discipline is given so that children  do not fear their parents, even though they know they will be punished for  improper behavior. Parents don&rsquo;t jump to conclusions about their children&rsquo;s  behavior but listen to them and use every opportunity to teach them. Husbands  and wives trust one another, and always  presume the best about each other. After taking children through  &ldquo;direction,&rdquo; &ldquo;coaching&rdquo; and &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; in a particular area, parents trust  their children and give them independence in that area. Husbands and wives encourage one another to pursue their &ldquo;dreams&rdquo;  for improving themselves (e.g. education, job, write a book, etc.). They  sacrifice themselves to let this happen.</p>
