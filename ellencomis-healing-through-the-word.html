            <h4>Healing Through The Word</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p><b>by Rev. Ellen Comis</b></p>
            </div>
            <p class="qa">ARE YOUR WORDS IN AGREEMENT WITH GOD&rsquo;S WORD?</p>
            <p>Are you praying for a  miracle?&nbsp; Is there a situation in your  life that needs God&rsquo;s healing touch? Today I would like to speak about the  importance of saying what God says about your situation and not allowing words  that are opposite to His Word come out of your mouth.&nbsp; Before I go any further let&rsquo;s look at what  the Bible has to say about words. </p>
            <p>Job.  22:28 <em>&ldquo;You will also decree a thing and it shall be established for you&hellip;&rdquo;</em> To decree something means: to announce, proclaim and declare and to state  emphatically. By us doing that we set up a firm basis to receive. What is that  firm basis? When we speak His word which has already been established in  heaven, we enforce it through a verbal agreement. Our words make the connection  between heaven and earth and whatever God established in hea&shy;ven is loosed in  our life by us speaking and believing His word. Circumstances and si&shy;tuations  begin to change.&nbsp; God said in Jeremiah  1:12, <em>&ldquo;I am ready to perform my word.&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>In  your everyday conversation do you find yourself speaking more about your fears,  the sickness in your body or perhaps your insecurity and inability to see your  life getting any better?&nbsp; If so, you will  have difficulty receiving what He won back for us at the cross. Jesus showed us  how to receive His promises and bring about change in our life.&nbsp; God truly cares about what you are going through  and that is why in Mark 16:17 He gave us authority to use the power of His  Name, taught us how to pray and in Mark 11:23 we see how the power of God&rsquo;s  Word changed a situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>In  Prov. 13:3 God is showing us just how powerful our words are and that what we  speak will affect our destiny. It says, <em>&ldquo;He that keeps his mouth keeps his  life but he that opens wide his lips shall have destruction.&rdquo; </em>Prov. 18:21  says, <em>&ldquo;Life and death are in the POWER of the TONGUE and those who love it  will eat its fruit.&rdquo;</em> Matt. 12:34 <em>says, &ldquo;&hellip;for out of the abundance of the  heart the mouth speaks.&rdquo;</em> Jesus is saying that your mouth is going to give  away what is really in your heart.&nbsp; Matt.  12:35 says, <em>&ldquo;A good man out of the treasure of his heart brings forth good  things and an evil man brings forth evil things.&rdquo;</em> The word treasure means  deposit. So if man is not depositing good things in his heart (spirit) like  God&rsquo;s Word, then the Word will not come out. He said we would be held  accountable for what we say. Matt. 12:36 says, <em>&ldquo;But I say to you, that every  idle word that men shall speak, they will give account thereof in the Day of  Judgment.&rdquo; </em>Wow! Many do not realize that the negative words they speak  every day may be the reason why they are not seeing victory in their life. You  are decreeing what you don&rsquo;t want even though you are praying for a  miracle.&nbsp; You may need to do what David  did.&nbsp; David knew that his weakness were  the words that came out of his mouth so he prayed, <em>&ldquo;Set a guard O&rsquo;Lord over  my mouth, keep a watch over the door of my lips.&rdquo; </em>Ps. 141:3 </p>
            <p>I  would like to ask you a question. Are you believing for a good report and  answer to prayer? Are your words in agreement with what the Word of God says  about your situation? If not, you must get before Jesus and pray. Healing is in  the Atonement and belongs to you, but God knows exactly where your faith is at.  Therefore you need to get the <u>mind of God and the direction of the Holy  Spirit on what path you are to take for your healing.</u> God is not against  doctors or medicine. There are times when He will guide you to have surgery or  take medicine as you continue to grow in Him and His Word.&nbsp; The mistake a lot of Christians make is  telling God how to do it. That is not faith it&rsquo;s presumption. Whether you use  doctors or medicine Jesus is still the healer and what is most important, is  that you recover.&nbsp; As you draw close to  the Holy Spirit He will reveal what path you are to take. Ps. 37:23 says, <em>&ldquo;The  steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>
            <p>Have  you ever heard someone say &ndash;<em> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that stuff about watching what  you say because it can affect your life.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;  First of all it is not <em>&lsquo;stuff&rsquo;</em> its God&rsquo;s Word. When Jesus came to  earth everything that He said was because His father told Him to say it.  Jn.12:49 says, <em>&ldquo;I have not spoken on my own authority but the Father who  sent me He gave me a command what I should say.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; If Jesus was obedient to what the Father told  Him to say, why do we speak opposite of the Word of God and wonder why our  prayers are not answered. God gave us authority to speak what the Word of God  says about a situation and His Word spoken in faith can bring change and  healing.</p>
