            <h4>Healing Through The Word</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p><b>by Rev. Ellen Comis</b></p>
            </div>
            <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>BIBLE FAITH</strong></p>
            
            <p>In Heb.  11:1 it says, <em>&ldquo;Now faith is the <u>substance</u> of things hoped for, the <u>evidence</u> of things not seen.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; It is the power by which things that we  desire become the things that we possess.  Faith is an intangible (indescriba&shy;ble) commodity (product or service).  You can&rsquo;t see it &ndash; touch it &ndash;measure it or weigh it. Yet its power can move  mountains. What is so remarkable is that there have been times when I have felt <em>&lsquo;this faith&rsquo;</em> come upon me. When it  did, I have said things to people and had them do something that did not seem  possible. If I had stopped for a moment and reasoned it out, the healing would have never happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>FAITH DOES NOT </strong><strong>OPERATE BY REASON</strong></p>
            <p>A woman came for pra&shy;yer. She had a glass  eye. Af&shy;ter prayer I told her to cover the good eye and tell me what she saw.  She replied, <em>&ldquo;But I have a glass eye I can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</em> I said, <em>&ldquo;Please do what I said.&rdquo;</em> She covered her  good eye and the miracle power of God hit her and she could see out of the  glass eye. What happened? God&rsquo;s faith was dropped in my spirit. I must be  honest with you, if I had taken more time and thought about what <em>I was about to say, &lsquo;reason would have taken  over&rsquo;</em> and I would not have said it. Remember, faith does not operate by  reason. It is a product of the heart, the spirit of man. With God all things  are possible.</p>
            <p>What every Christian should realize is, of ourselves we cannot  produce faith. Faith is not given to us because we believe that if we repeat  scripture over and over healing will take place. There are no spiritual  ingredients that we can mix together to make real Bible faith. Should we  confess the Word regarding healing? Yes.&nbsp;  Not to make it happen, but to acknowledge <u>what has already taken  place at the Cross of Calvary.</u> When we do that the power of God is  released. Jesus has done everything that can be done in regard to your healing.  He paid the full price with His shed Blood and by His Stripes we are  healed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>WHAT IS THE GOD KIND OF FAITH</strong></p>
            <p>When we are Born-Again, God fine-tunes  our hearing and if we are truly His disciple and studying His Word we can begin  to hear in another dimension. In Mark 11 we read about Je&shy;sus speaking to the  fig tree and it begins to dry up by the roots. The disciples were amazed at  what they saw and heard and in v.22 Jesus said to them, <em>&ldquo;Have faith in God&rdquo;</em> or as the Greek translation says, <em>&ldquo;Have the God kind of faith.&rdquo;</em> What is  the <em>&ldquo;The God kind of faith?&rsquo;</em>&nbsp; Look at Rom. 10:17,&nbsp; &ldquo;Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the  word of God.&rdquo; In the Greek Testament it reads, <em>&ldquo;Faith comes by hearing and  hearing by a word of God.&rdquo; </em>The word <em>&lsquo;hearing&rsquo;</em> in Greek means, <em>&lsquo;&hellip;something incredible  has happened, all of a sudden what we are hearing, comes alive in our hearts.&rsquo; </em>Our  spiritual ears have opened up. Praise the Lord!</p>
            <p>In the Gospel of John it says, <em>&ldquo;My sheep hear my voice, and they follow  me.&rdquo;</em> The Pharisees heard Him al&shy;so with their natural ears. They sat under  His teaching and yet it brought no change. When  a child of God hears Jesus speak to them even just a word like <em>(you&rsquo;re healed!)</em> there is a knowing  inside and no-one can talk you out of it. The scriptures come alive and you  know, like you know it&rsquo;s done! (That&rsquo;s not name it and claim it) That&rsquo;s God  dropping <strong>His faith</strong> into your spirit  and the Word has come alive inside of you. It&rsquo;s not just black print on white  paper. That&rsquo;s the God kind of faith.</p>
            <p>In Rom. 10:17 it says, <em>&ldquo;&hellip;and  hearing by the word&hellip;&rdquo;</em> In the Greek that word is translated to mean <em>&lsquo;that which had been spoken by a living voice.&rsquo;</em> Wow! Praise the Lord! Are you getting this? I am not changing the  translation but clarifying it so we can understand  it better. Let me say it this way, (my words.) <em>Faith comes from what we are hearing and if we are listening intently -  what we are hearing by-passes our mind and comes alive in our spirit and is  spoken by a living voice.</em> Who is that living voice? Jesus. Hallelujah! </p>
            <p>In this world, there are many voices  that we can hear. There is the voice of man - the voice of the devil - and the  voice of the Holy Spirit. What you hear must always agree with the Word of God.  If you have never given your heart to Jesus &ndash; do it NOW. Say, <em>&ldquo;Lord please forgive me of all my sin &ndash; I  want to live for you, come into my heart today and I ask that in the precious  name of Jesus.&rdquo;</em> THIS IS THE GREA&shy;TEST MIRACLE!</p>
