            <h4>Healing Through The Word</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p><b>by Rev. Ellen Comis</b></p>
            </div>
            <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>IT&#8200;IS&#8200;FINISHED</p>
            <p align="center">All the  blessings and promises that are in the Bible were crea&shy;ted by the love of God.  He loved us so much that He sent His Son Jesus so we could be Saved, Healed and  Delivered. How do we receive these blessings and promises? Many times we are  waiting on God to send them. We pray <em>&ldquo;God  I need healing and deliverance&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; and we  wait for God to send those promises to us. But God does not control the timing  for miracles &ndash; <u>our faith does.</u> It is much easier to blame God for not  respond<em>ing to us and cry &ldquo;God don&rsquo;t you  hear me?&rdquo;</em> then to take the guilt of realizing that the responsibility of believing and receiving is  on our part.            </p>
            <p>Jesus did all that He could do for your  Salvation, Healing and Deliverance.&nbsp; In  Gal. 3:13 it says, <em>&ldquo;Christ redeemed us  from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us so that the blessings  of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive  the promise of the Spirit through faith.&rdquo;</em> The Cross provided the way for  Jew and Gentile to be justified and made righteous through His Blood.&nbsp; All satanic powers were defeated at Calvary.&nbsp; The devil does not have power over you unless  you give it to him.</p>
            <p>When Jesus cried out<em> &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo;</em> that meant:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;1. Finished &ndash; was the payment for our sin.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;2. Finished &ndash; was satan&rsquo;s control over  mankind.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;3. Finished &ndash; was the ability of sickness and  disease to control and destroy.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;4. Finished - was the hopelessness of mankind.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;5. Finished &ndash;was the control of addictions  over our loved ones.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;6. Finished &ndash;was the spirit of fear and  anxiety controlling our lives.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;7. Finished&ndash;was the  destruction of marriages.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;8. Finished&ndash;was the demo&shy;nic control of our  minds.</p>
            <p align="center" class="qa">YOU MUST BELIEVE THIS &ndash; AND ACTIVATE IT BY  YOUR FAITH</p>
            <p>Then He gave all power and authority to  His church and said in Mark 16:15-18 <em>&ldquo;Go  into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, he who believes and is baptized will be saved: he who does  not will be condemned, and these signs will follow those who believe, in My  Name they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents, and if they  drink anything deadly it will by no means hurt them they will lay hands on the  sick and they shall recover.</em>&nbsp; </p>
            <p>We must learn to release our faith to  receive the promises and blessings of God.&nbsp;  Remember the woman that had an issue of blood for 12 years? Well, as  Jesus walked the cities many were healed but there were many that he never  prayed for.&nbsp; Matt. 9:18 says, He was in Capernaum and a ruler came to Him and asked  that He pray for his daughter. As He arose and followed him a woman who had an  issue of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His  garment, for she said to herself, <em>&ldquo;If I  can touch the hem of His garment I will</em> <em>be  healed.&rdquo;</em> She was! Jesus turned around and  said, <em>&ldquo;Who </em><em>touched me?&rdquo; </em>It seemed as if He had no  plans to pray for her &ndash; but she released her faith, because <u>she was  determined to be healed.</u></p>
            <p>What God makes available to us through  His blessings are not necessarily pre- destined, it depends on our faith.  Numbers 23:19 says, <em>&ldquo;God is not a man  that He should lie nor a Son of man that He should repent, has He said and will  He not do, or has He spoken and will He not make it good?</em> That is one of  the most powerful scriptures in the Bible.&nbsp;  GOD DESIRES TO BE BELIEVED AND  TRUSTED COMPLETELY. Faith is simply confidence in God and what His Word says, <u>His  Word </u>must come out of your mouth not  what you see, feel or hear. God impregnates His Words with confidence and as  you read them they become a reality to your spirit.&nbsp; When you read the Word of God and God&rsquo;s  healing scriptures read them out loud &ndash; faith comes by hearing and hearing by  the Word of God.</p>
            <p class="qa">Testimony:</p>
            <p>Mary  McCabe Sea Cliff, NY</p>
            <p>For about 6 months I was in constant  pain in my feet, legs and back so that I could hardly walk. I could not turn  over in bed without screaming in pain. Doctors could not diagnose what was  wrong. On May 30th I went to Ellen&rsquo;s Healing Service. When Ellen touched me the  wonderful power of God went through me.  When I went to sleep that night I didn&rsquo;t want to turn over because I was  expecting that terrible pain in my back &ndash; but when I did, there was no more  pain in my back, feet or legs. I have been pain free ever since.&nbsp; Thank you Jesus!</p>
