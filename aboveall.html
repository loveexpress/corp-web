              <p>Pastor Maria D. Lites</p>
            </div>
      <p >There have been many pioneers in the gospel, those whom God has used to originate, or take part in the development of, the laying of a foundation on the Word of God. Dr. Maria D. Lites, pastor of <strong>UNBROKEN CHAIN CHURCH</strong>, is one of the pioneers in the gospel who was called by God to lay such a foundation right here in New York City.</p>
      <p>Pastor Maria, as she is known, is a native of Brooklyn, NY. She was raised in a Christian home and accepted the Lord at the tender age of nine. God&rsquo;s call has always been on her life. Having served as a youth class leader in her church, she went on to become a counselor with the Billy Graham Crusade at the age of seventeen. During her early years, Pastor Maria ministered around the world with The Full Gospel Businessmen&rsquo;s Fellowship Int&rsquo;l and the Women&rsquo;s Aglow Fellowship. As a minister at Tabernacle of Prayer for All People in Jamaica, Queens, NY (pastored by the late Apostle Johnnie L. Washington), she co-founded and taught at the Tabernacle of Prayer Bible Institute.</p>
      <p>It was there that she was approached by a member, William D. Pointer, to start a Bible study at his family&rsquo;s home. The Bible study began in 1979 around the dining room table in the family&rsquo;s home. They began to invite friends and co-workers from show business to come. Pastor Maria recalls, &ldquo;The people that came really came to hear about Jesus. Some had been to churches and stated that they did not want to go [back]. Many of the church leaders would often call them out [because they were big names] to give a testimony about show business and/ or the world. Others would just stargaze. I saw them as souls for the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The world of show business is not a very large world, and word was spreading rapidly (before internet) about the Bible study. The power of God was falling and many people were being saved, healed and delivered from demonic spirits.</p>
      <p><strong>THE NAME / VISION FROM GOD</strong></p>
      <p>The name UNBROKEN CHAIN came about in 1980 while Pastor Maria was traveling on a ministry trip to California with her brother in the Lord, the late Pastor Archie L. Dennis, Jr. Having originally gone for a meeting with the Full Gospel Businessmen&rsquo;s Fellowship Int&rsquo;l, the two also ministered to a group of believers who were also in show business. While there, the Lord spoke to Pastor Maria and said, &ldquo;The name of the fellowship [at the time, it was a fellowship] was to be UNBROKEN CHAIN. You will be linking your hands around the world to bring the message of Jesus Christ. It will be as a chain&hellip;that if one link comes apart, He will lay His hand and clasp it together, that there would not be a broken link.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Shortly after returning to New York, Pastor Maria was in a car accident. While on a stretcher in the hospital hallway, she cried out to the Lord. God spoke to her these words: &ldquo;Look down the corridor. What do you see?&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I see a long corridor.&rdquo; Her account continues: &ldquo;All of a sudden the doors opened wide and I saw thousands of people of all races and colors just mingling around.&rdquo; God said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to take you to&hellip;that place where you will be ministering around the world the power of God unto salvation &hellip;to people of every nation, creed and color.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong>MOVE TO MANHATTAN</strong></p>
      <p>In 1982, the door opened for a second weekly meeting to start in midtown, New York City. Two members of the group were appearing in a much-acclaimed Broadway musical. They held a backstage Bible study between the mid-week matinee and evening shows. Others in the cast came and brought their friends. Pastor Maria says, &ldquo;God was sending me to the area where the people to whom we were ministering were, right in the center of Times Square. It was convenient to those in the business, and they were very happy to come right from the job to the place where we would be meeting. Many miracles were taking place between shows&hellip; people were being healed, set free and filled with the Holy Ghost. Some were going back to their Broadway shows drunk in the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Eventually, they outgrew the backstage facility and began holding meetings at a nearby Church.</p>
      <p>The Monday night fellowship in Brooklyn had outgrown the house. The house was filled with people. Not just with people from show business, but with those connected with the business (models, designers, etc.) and with family and friends. The place became so crowded that they moved from the dining room to the basement and that became crowded as well. UNBROKEN CHAIN FELLOWSHIP had already been going forth as an outreach ministry. They were invited to conduct revival meetings in local churches, minister in hospitals, and they preached on the streets and in the parks in New York City.</p>
      <p>In December of 1982, Pastor Maria was ordained. &ldquo;When the Lord called me to be a pastor,&rdquo; she recounts, &ldquo;I had served Him for many years as an evangelist and teacher. Now the Lord placed before me the biggest challenge I had ever known&hellip;the care of the Flock. Every question&hellip; every misgiving I had, the Lord addressed. I could say nothing but, &lsquo;Yes, Lord, I&rsquo;ll go where you want me to go&hellip;I&rsquo;ll do what you want me to do&hellip;I&rsquo;ll say what you want me to say.&rsquo;&rdquo; The ordination took place in December of 1982. In 1984 on Palm Sunday, UNBROKEN CHAIN CHURCH held its first Sunday service in Manhattan at Madelyn Burns Studio in the Ed Sullivan Building on Broadway and 53rd, with Pastor Maria D. Lites bringing her first sermon as pastor.</p>
      <p>The congregation at the time was composed mostly of actors, singers, musicians, dancers, writers, models, designers&hellip;SOULS! The services were filled with praise and worship. Something Pastor Maria had always emphasized. The Word of God was being preached and taught, and all of the gifts of the Spirit were in full operation. Members were allowed&hellip;encouraged&hellip;to use their gifts and talents, as they surrendered to the Lord. &ldquo;They gave back to God what He had given them,&rdquo; according to Pastor Maria. The Spirit of the Lord said, &ldquo;I will have them minister unto Me. Each department will be called a &lsquo;ministry&rsquo;&rdquo;&hellip;drama ministry, scribe ministry, music ministry, dance ministry, etc. Some of these ministries were new in the church world. And there were times that UNBROKEN CHAIN was criticized for it. In spite of the criticism, Pastor Maria was obedient to God. The church went forth in the gifts that God had given them. They were able, by the grace and power of God, to minister, not just within the four walls of the building, but also in off-Broadway theatres with Spirit-filled productions which glorified God.</p>
      <p><strong>MINISTRY TODAY</strong></p>
      <p>God is still moving mightily by His Spirit in the ministry. The congregation consists of people from all walks of life. New York City is the ministry&rsquo;s home base.  To quote Pastor Maria, &ldquo;God has called us to build on the foundation in New York City. I know God has sent me to New York and that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve laboured.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Over the years, He has (as He said He would) sent UNBROKEN CHAIN CHURCH around the world with the gospel. The church has ministered in Israel, Jordan, Egypt, England, France, Alaska, the Philippines, mainland China (including Hong Kong), Peru, Mexico, Indonesia, Italy, Sicily, Canada (including the Mohawk territory in Montreal), Ethiopia, Greece and Sweden. Most recently, God spoke to Pastor Maria concerning our own country, the United States: &ldquo;He said He was sending us throughout our nation with the gospel&hellip;that America would know the power of God unto salvation.&rdquo; Fulfilling that mandate has taken the church to Tennessee and Nebraska within the last two years.</p>
      <p>Upon learning of her daughter&rsquo;s surrender to Jesus at a young age, Pastor Maria&rsquo;s mother gave her these words of wisdom:  &ldquo;Above all, obey God.&rdquo; Says Pastor Maria, &ldquo;This is what I&rsquo;ve always tried to do&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve taught my congregation that very same thing.&rdquo;</p>
