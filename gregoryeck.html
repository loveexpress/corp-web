              Upper Room Christian World Center</p>
            </div>
      <p class="articlecredits" >&ldquo;I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.&rdquo; (I Tim 2:1-8; KJV)</p>
      <p>In the passage from I Timothy, the Apostle Paul teaches his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; Timothy about corporate prayer. He exhorts Timothy to pray in four forms: supplications, prayers intercessions, and thanksgiving. A study of the four Greek words the Apostle Paul uses in this text is important to gain an understanding about how we are to pray corporately as New Testament blood-washed children of God.</p>
      <p>We are to begin by supplication. In the Greek New Testament, the English word translated &ldquo;supplications&rdquo; according to Strong&rsquo;s Concordance is <em>deehis</em> (pronounced deh'-ay-sis), which means &ldquo;request, need, want, privation, penury, a seeking, asking, entreating, entreaty to God or to man.&rdquo; It is usually a form of prayer that involves crying out to God to meet a personal need for your own self, rather than for another. It may be a cry to Him with fervent emotion or intensity.</p>
      <p>The NT Greek word translated &ldquo;prayers&rdquo; is <em>proseuche</em> (pronounced pros-yoo-khay'), which means &ldquo;prayer (worship); by implication an oratory (chapel); pray earnestly.&rdquo; This implies worship of God as an element of prayer, as well as to pray sincerely or earnestly to God for the needs of the petitioner.</p>
      <p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;intercessions&rdquo; is <em>enteuxis</em> (pronounced ent'-yook -sis), which means &ldquo;an interview; supplication:-intercession, prayer.&rdquo; The root word it is derived from is <em>entugchano</em>, which conveys the idea of &ldquo;to confer with; by extension to entreat (for or against); deal with; make intercession.</p>
      <p>The final NT Greek word Paul uses which is translated &ldquo;giving of thanks&rdquo; is <em>eucharistia</em>, (pronounced yoo-khar-is-tee'-ah); meaning &ldquo;gratitude; grateful language (to God, as an act of worship):- thankfulness, (giving of) thanks (-giving).&rdquo; As the English translation implies, the Greek word means giving thanks to God as an act of worship to Him.</p>
      <p>Thus, we are to offer these four types of prayer for:</p>
      <p>A. <strong>All men</strong> - every man, woman boy and girl on planet earth today.</p>
      <p>B. <strong>Kings and all that are in authority.</strong> This includes people in positions of authority and leadership roles, from the President of the United States down to our local political officials.</p>
      <p>We are to pray for ourselves and our needs with supplications; however, we must also pray beyond ourselves, and understand the need to pray for people all over the world, particularly those in leadership roles. We are to pray for them as God commanded through the Apostle Paul. This is not a suggestion; it is the commandment of the Lord. We cannot complain about the state of affairs in the world or our nation today if we fail to do what God commanded the church through Paul. We must pray for men, so that God can send His Spirit to them to convict them of sin, draw them unto Jesus, and bring them to the point of receiving Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>We must also pray for our leaders, so that we may have righteous and God-fearing men and women elected to political and spiritual offices of government. Man&rsquo;s choice is not always God&rsquo;s choice. We must pray for His will to be accomplished in the realm of government so that the church can carry our her divine mission to preach the Gospel and teach all nations (Matthew 28:19-20) as our Lord commanded us, without persecution or hindrance by human governments.</p>
      <p>Each Tuesday night at 7:30PM for the past several years, hundreds of people have been coming to Upper Room Christian World Center and have been praying in accordance with this passage of scripture. We supplicate for our personal needs, and we intercede on behalf of others, including the Body of Christ, this nation and the nations of the world. We have seen many prayers answered as we worship, offer thanksgiving, petition the Throne of God, supplicate and intercede. Come and join us as we operate in the spiritual reality of I Timothy 2:1-8 each week. We are expecting and receiving healing and deliverance from all manner of sicknesses, diseases, bondages and afflictions. We have recently begun taking prayer requests from around the nation over the internet in real time and praying fervently for those needs during our prayer meetings. Come out and be blessed!</p>
