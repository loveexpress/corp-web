              <p>How great  is this: Empowering and equipping ministry, for real college credit, and for a small fraction of the usual cost? Better  yet, this program is coming very soon near you!</p>
              <p>More than ever before, men and women  committed to significant ministry for our Lord Jesus Christ must be equipped  and empowered through education that is Bible-based, Christ-centered,  Spirit-led, and excellent. The Lord clearly wants us to study the Bible carefully,  to get trained, and to empower others through their training, too. This need  for educational empowerment has always been crucial, but now more than ever&mdash;as  life is more and more complicated, and as the people in our communities are  becoming more aware, too. Even pastors with accredited seminary degrees should still take  one or two excellent courses a year for their continuing education, to help  maintain their crucial mental and spiritual  vibrancy.</p>
              <img style="float:right; padding: 10px 0 10px 10px;" src="images/drdondavis.jpg" width="175" height="208">
              <p>However, the continuing problem for us  in the New York area is that excellent ministry and leadership training has  been too expensive or too elusive. But there is every reason why significant  ministry training should be affordable and  achievable. Of course, we fully understand the costs of beautiful campuses  and highly educated professors. We understand those costs and respect those  professors. But we serve the gracious Creator of all good things, and we are  creative people, too! </p>
              <p>Now, there is an excellent new model of  ministry training invading New York City this fall. It is holistic,  college-level, Bible-based, Christ-centered, Spirit-led, affordable, and  achievable. This creative ministry training model is provided by the newly  established New York Urban Ministry Institute (NYUMI),  affiliated with World Impact, a vibrant Los Angeles-based ministry.  World Impact has created this out- standing Capstone Curriculum of 16 excellent  modules that will now be taught in New York for the first time. The Curriculum  covers the full range of ministry skills, including four modules in Biblical  Studies, four in Theology and Ethics, four in ministry, and four in  specifically urban flourishing. I have inspected these modules and they are all  intensely well designed&mdash;Biblical, thorough, interesting, empowering.</p>
              <p>All the Capstone Curri&shy;culum modules  were crafted by a gifted, evangelical, African-American, preacher-scholar&mdash;the  brilliant <strong>Rev. Don L. Davis</strong>,  PhD.&nbsp; Dr. Da&shy;vis earned his college and  Master&rsquo;s degrees from Whea&shy;ton College and then his Ph.D. in Religion from the  University of Iowa. Each of the nine 2-hour class meetings in each module  includes affirmations of faith, scripture reading, scripture memorization, two case study discussions,  specific ministry planning, Biblical exegesis, a 25-minute DVD lecture by Dr.  Davis, discussion, and question and answer time.&nbsp; Every student must devote at least 5 hours of  work outside of class each week. The materials are so well-crafted that the  local facilitators for the modules do not need to be experts on the related  subject matter. The holistic ministry training of the Capstone Curriculum is  tremendously empowering.</p>
              <p>Great News: The leaders of both Nyack  College and Lancaster Bible College endorse this program and will give college credit to anyone  transferring to them any module or the whole Curriculum. Each module receives  1.5-1.7 credits, or 24-27 cre&shy;dits for all 16 modules. NYUMI will also issue  certificates and endorsements for ordination.</p>
              <p>In addition,  students who have already earned their college degrees may choose  Master&rsquo;s-level homework for each module, and work toward their Master&rsquo;s level  certificates and diplomas in an agreement with the NY Divinity School.</p>
              <p>The true priority: men and women need  excellent training, for excellent mini&shy;stry, that serves our excellent Lord.  Mindless sincerity has been excused far too often.  Unskilled meanderings in the place of ministry have led to the tragic  loss of much of the Church&rsquo;s influence. Trained ministers need continuing education, and under-trained and  future ministers need recognized, NYUMI&rsquo;s excellent equipping and empowering.  The Capstone Curriculum is the equipping and empowering that our leaders and  minister need.</p>
              <p>Become involved two ways: First, you can  sign up for one or more of the at least five NYUMI classes now scheduled to  start mid-September in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.&nbsp; See www.NYUMI.net for details. Second, write  to DrPaul@NYUMI.net if your church or ministry would like to host future  courses. We can bring the whole program to you.</p>
