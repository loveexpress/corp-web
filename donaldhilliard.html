              <p align="center"><strong></strong>It feels  like it happened quickly: first seminary, then  marriage and babies, pastoring a church, and the stuff of life in  between. I was married in 1981, graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary  and became a father in 1982, and was leading a  church by 1983. So something always filled the empty spaces of my life&mdash;the voi&shy;ces of my children, the highs and lows of  ministry, and daily parish life.</p>
<p>Then I  blinked, and our three daughters had grown up and left the safety of our home  for college and marriage and to make uniquely blessed lives of their own.  Things quieted, and I struggled with the new mathematical configuration of my family home, reduced now to two. That's  when my physical health began to feel the impact of my expanding waistline and  a sometimes unco- operative maturing and ach&shy;ing body.</p>
<p>Middle  age. For some, those two simple words can instill fear. All of us have heard  stories from friends about someone in the midst of midlife and the shiny new  sports car. In an effort to tell stories that truly speak to the needs of  pastors, I interviewed a number of faith leaders who were willing to share  their midlife stories with me (when referring to them, I use pseudonyms). They  shed their invisible, cle&shy;rical robes and were  bold and brave in their confessions. Their stories have value because all of us can learn from their  experiences to develop solutions to better manage our own lives and our own  ministries.</p>
<p class="qa">Jarman: Favor ain't Fair</p>
<p align="center"><strong></strong>One  pastor spoke of a personal and professional &quot;perfect storm,&quot; the  confluence of extraordinary events crashing  together catapulting him into a crisis shortly after a parent died. This  minister, Jarman, had children leaving for college, a wife who had her own work  to do, and a significant church project in the  making. None of those issues were in the sphere of his ability to govern  or relate, so he started to spin out of control.</p>
<p>&quot;I  came up in a family that was out of control,&quot; he said. &quot;Therefore, my response when I became grown was to take  control of everything: my environment, my house, myself, my wife, my  kinds. [With the family member's death] my natural response was to take control. But at that point, I had to  admit I wasn't in control &hellip;. I was functionally depressed. The church was  growing, but I was not emotionally or spiritually there. I was preaching every  Sunday, but it was angry preaching.</p>
<p>&quot;One  time during our men's revival, the preacher was preaching, but it was so hollow  for me. Nothing was wrong with his message, but it was hollow for me. I said to  myself, 'I don't want to hear this [expletive].' And I walked out and left. The  amazing thing is that nobody realized anything was wrong .... My whole world  was spiraling .... This was the first time in my adult life I was alone as a  man, and the sisters from the congregation were coming out of the woodwork to  'help' me in any way I wan&shy;ted.&quot;</p>
<p>This  pastor, a phenomenal preacher, teacher, and theologian, began to drink,  something he did not normally do, to soothe what he could not. &quot;It's  possible this was an alcoholic season in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;I did  not go to therapy or talk to a friend. I couldn't call my pastor because I was  the favored son. I was Joseph. How does the favorite son go to his pastor and  say, 'Favor ain't fair'? I couldn't tell my church because they needed me to be  strong. I couldn't tell my officers because that would put my job in jeopardy.  I realized then that there are some things  worse than dying. One of them is at the moment of death to realize you  were ne&shy;ver truly loved because you were never really known. That changed me  and allowed me to begin to be authentically who I am today.&quot;</p>
<p class="qa">Junior:Signs of Transition</p>
<p align="center">A close  preacher friend of mine, Junior, said he knew midlife was approaching when his  memory started slipping and his &quot;sensitivity gauge&quot; was on constant  high alert. &quot;That was a huge factor for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I used to  be able to remember numbers easily; now when people give them to me, I have to  write them down. Also, now I am more aware of my emotions, and how I'm feeling  inside is an important indicator. I am used to having emotional feelings, but  they weren't all that important to me. Now I  appear to be much more sensitive to what I am feeling emotionally. I  even think emotionally.&quot;</p>
<p>Emotions.  Those are tricky things for most men. Somewhere in the universe of statistical  data there is a numerical indicator about middle-aged men being suicidal and  not even knowing why. Perhaps that is the greatest and most disturbing aspect  for men, and for our purposes specifically  pastors, struggling with their midlife transitions. We know clearly  something is happening to us, to our bodies, our sense of self and how we maneuver through space. What we do not know is  how to explain it or how to talk about it, because for most of us it has not  been part of our male nurturing, theological training, or maturation process.  Regrettably, men will simply suffer in silence, sometimes resulting in  irreparable and devastating consequences, when in fact there is no need to agonize  alone.</p>
<p class="qa">Jericho: Filling the Void</p>
<p>When I  talk with ministerial colleagues who are go&shy;ing  through rough times, I urge them to bear their &quot;stuff&quot; to a  counselor. That is what I did, and I unreservedly recommend it as a first  steppingstone on the journey. Whether sought  from a fellow member of the clergy or from a professional therapist, counseling  may not be the easiest choice, but it is one of the wisest.</p>
<p>In an effort to get through his own  midlife onset, ano&shy;ther minister, Jericho,  told me that he turned to a spiritual director, a faith-based counselor  who acts as a guide, to find footing in his life. He felt it necessary to tell  his story to someone else in order to heal what he could not see or define.</p>
<p>&quot;My  piece was triggered when I finished my doctor of ministry degree and I just  felt a void,&quot; Jericho said. &quot;Our denomination provides us an  opportunity to get some level of counseling. I knew something was wrong [with  me], but I didn't know what it was. It was revealed to me for the first time in  counseling that I had completed all my education,  and once I finished, it left a void. That void was going to be filled  with unhealthy activity, I was sure.</p>
<p>&quot;At  that point, I definitely knew something was wrong with me and I had to do  something. The physical changes&mdash;I wasn't working out as much as I used to. The  ministry was taking off and doing well, and because of that, I was a little  bored. So I filled the void by getting spiritual direction. I have a spiritual  director who helps me to see God moving in my life. Spiritual direction has  been the best thing that ever happened to me .... It has been a powerful experience.&quot; Jericho  found a path that worked and allowed him to rebuild, reconnect, and restore.</p>
<p class="qa">Harcourt: A Square Peg in a Round Hole</p>
<p align="center">One  middle-aged prea&shy;cher, Harcourt, was the oldest but smallest in size of his  siblings, whom he raised. He grew up in what he called a &quot;divorced and  fractured family&quot; and was always in  pursuit of approval and praise, though for him it was an elusive search.  &quot;I think [growing up] I had always been an overachiever, trying to hear  the approval of my mother, others, and my peers,&quot; he said. &quot;I never  envisioned myself being a mega-church pastor &hellip; and having experienced  instantaneous success gave me the false satis- faction of having arrived. But  when I looked around, my peers didn't acknowledge that growth and that success.  One preacher told me that my preaching style was nonlinear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another preacher helped me  understand why I don't fit, why I don't get invited to preach, and why I don't  fit in with the clique,&quot; Harcourt said. &quot;He said, 'It's hard to be  around the authentic when you are inauthentic.'  He reminded me that it was OK to not fit. I am just beginning to settle  into the fact I am not going to fit and I may not be on the preaching circuit  or the televangelist circuit. But I have settled into the call God has given me  to be a local pastor, and my job is to build up my community and to live out my  purpose for my generation. I have finally settled into that, but it has been  very hard, very lonely, and very painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  minister's midlife struggles stemmed from unfulfilled affirmation as a child.  Later on, as a pastor, he found himself looking for approval in what could be called the darker side of ministry, and he  pacified and appeased himself the only way he knew how, with secret sexual  relationships. Those actions, though, put him in a direct and personal  spiritual battle with his beliefs, between what he preached and how he was  living. He eventually sought help and made his midlife confusion work.</p>
<p class="qa">Finding your Own Trail</p>
<p align="center">Although  our stories differ, the pain is the same. The Christian men who trusted me with  their tales are a group of insightful, talented preachers and teachers who have  grappled with their issues but are working on transforming to better their  ministries. Each one of them found his own trail. King Da&shy;vid wrote psalms,  poetry set to music, to ease his pain. I talked through my problems, and I  continue to confide and confess what presses on my heart.</p>
<p>I think I  will always long for the sound of my daughters when they were young. But things  change, and life is not a stagnant, steady state. Emotional and psychological  transitions need to be seen for what they are and should not be looked upon  lightly. When midlife calls, there are real issues that need attention and answers. We all bear burdens. Bottom  line: prea&shy;cher, prophet, or priest, go&shy;ing it  alone is a lonely and thorny road, and one that does not have to be taken. Opening up to another  person requires trust, and trust can be hard to come by. But finding a level of  trust can make all the difference in managing mid&shy;life.</p>
