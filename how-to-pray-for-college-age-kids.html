            <h4 id="articleTitle">How To Pray For College-Age Kids</h4>
              <div id="authorname"> Excerpted, with permission, from Kevin Mc&shy;Alve</div>
              <p>1. <strong>Pray for your  child&rsquo;s relationships with their roommates and hall-mates.</strong></p>
              <p>One of the  blessings of living in a residential college setting is the opportunity to  learn in community. This means working through your academic learning with  others but also means learning by being in a community. It can be hard when  sinners live together in close proximity and share the stresses of school and  adjusting to new environments, but the fruit of learning how to work through  hard things and sharing life with other  believers is a beautiful thing worth wrestl&shy;ing  through the hardships (Psalm 133). These lessons and friendships can not only make college a good experience but serve students well down the  road in life. Please pray for the ups and downs of these relationships and that  growth and bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood will result.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>2. Pray for your child&rsquo;s relationships with members of the opposite  sex.</strong></p>
              <p>College is a  combination of wonderful excitement and mass confusion in this area. Students  are coming from all manner of different backgrounds and experiences and the  reality is that many students will find a spouse on this campus and many  students will not. In both situations there are joys and frustrations. Please  pray that God will use this opportunity to grow your child in their  understanding of being a bro&shy;ther or sister to members of the opposite sex and  to give direction, purity, freedom from fear and anxiety, peace, encouragement, and grace to these  interactions.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>3. Pray for your child&rsquo;s friends.</strong></p>
              <p>This could  also encompass the two above catego&shy;ries but Proverbs and other scriptures  speak often of the importance of our companions. Pray for wisdom for your child  in who they choose to spend time with. That they would make friends who  encourage them in their faith and that  they would be friends who do that for others.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>4.&nbsp; Pray for their involvement on  campus.</strong></p>
              <p>It is really  important for students to be involved in campus life either on their hall,  through a club, a service group, or some other avenue of connecting with and  getting to know others. Pray for discernment for your child as they seek to  make these decisions and balance various things going on in their lives. Pray  they would be willing to let some opportunities pass, but be bold to take  advantage of others.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>5. Pray for mentors for your child.</strong></p>
              <p>In addition to friends and other students, pray for the  leaders on your student's hall (RAs, etc.).&nbsp;  They are upperclassmen students who desire to serve your child and walk  alongside them. If your child is in one of these positions, pray for them and their  work as these provide excellent opportunities for God to work in and through  them. Pray for faculty and staff who interact with your students, and for  pastors and other members in the local church where your child attends.&nbsp; Pray that one or two of these people would be  equipped by God to connect with your child and speak the truth of Christ into  their life regularly.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>6. Pray for your child&rsquo;s church involvement.</strong></p>
              <p>If they happen to attend a Christian college, it can be  easy for students to think they get what they need in Bible classes, chapel,  and hall prayer times. Sleep can feel very urgent on a Sunday morning, so  please pray that your child will connect with a local congregation. It can be  scary and intimidating at times, but is a great means of grace in their lives.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>7. Pray that God&rsquo;s spirit makes your child&rsquo;s heart and mind alive to  the Scriptures and the gospel.</strong></p>
              <p>Being  surrounded by people who profess the same thing you do can easily lead to  assuming the gospel of Christ in our lives and taking the scriptures for  granted. Pray that in chapel, class, church, and personal devotions, the Holy  Spirit will awa&shy;ken your child&rsquo;s heart and mind to the truths of God&rsquo;s written  word and the work of Jesus, the Living Word.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>8. Pray that their identity would be found more and more in Christ.</strong></p>
              <p>Students deal  with issues such as physical appearance, religious reputation, acade&shy;mic or athletic prowess, good  relationships, bad relationships, future goals, past achievements, etc. All of  these and countless others are calling to students (and to all of us really),  and asking your sons and daughters to place their trust and hope of joy and  fulfillment in them. Pray that your child will hear the voice of Christ calling  loudly above all the others, and that they will grow in the joy that Paul knew  in Philippians 3 of being united with Christ and found in him.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>9. Pray that your child would grow in Christ-likeness.</strong></p>
              <p>Pray that as  they grow in their understanding of what Christ has done for them, they will  grow in his likeness, being quick to forgive and slow to anger, considering the interest of others before themselves, and looking for opportunities to serve others and show them the  love of Christ.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>10. Pray that your child would learn from his or her mistakes.</strong></p>
              <p>Part of  growing and learning is making mistakes along the way. Pray that these times of  frustration, disappointment, and even embarrassment would help them to grow in  their understanding of the grace of Christ, mature as the young men and women  they are, and would guard them from larger frustration, disappointments, and  embarrassments in the future.</p>
              <p>And one to grow on ~</p>
              <p>Pray that they  would know God more.</p>
              <p>Following Paul's prayer for the Colossians&ndash;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;May you be  filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and  understanding, so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to  him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of  God.&rdquo;Colossians 1:9b-10.</p>
