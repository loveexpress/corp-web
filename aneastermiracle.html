            </div>
      <p >May 28th of this year in the second year since I was struck by a school bus crossing a street in Brooklyn, NY. I have no recollection of the accident and I woke up in a hospital bed a few weeks later. Although my wife was told I may die, or survive as a vegetable in a coma, I still pulled out to the amazement of most. Even though I still have some physical and cognitive issues I&rsquo;m progressing toward a total recovery.</p>
      <p>Once I regained my consciousness and my wife visited me in the hospital I told her she would be the new pastor of our church. Our membership agreed and Margie began leading the ministry. </p>
      <p>Three months after the accident I was released from the hospital and continued with physical and cognitive therapy. After a while I was able to walk, talk and think a lot better. Because the accident caused brain injury to me I still have some ability to focus and concentrate. Margie always shares with people how God is working in me throughout this time. She always tells people that God has me &ldquo;on the shelf&rdquo; to bring me a full and complete recovery.</p>
      <p>I began to think about Joseph, the son of Jacob, how he has gone through many different trials in his life until God has promoted him.</p>
      <p>As Joseph had a great dream from God, his parents were confused with him. Gen. 37:10 &ndash; &ldquo;When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, &quot;What is this dream you had?&rdquo; What in the world is he dreaming about? As a young man the Lord had spoke to my heart saying &ldquo;I have called you to the people nobody wants!&rdquo; I told my parents I was going to a Bible Institute to prepare for the ministry. Coming from a Roman Catholic background they couldn&rsquo;t understand what God is doing with me. They thought I lost my mind.</p>
      <p>I attended a 3 year Bible Institute that at that time was called a &ldquo;faith school.&rdquo; They never charged tuition or room and board for all the students. They lived by faith and imparted the &ldquo;faith&rdquo; lifestyle to its students. Faith, not for personal gain, but faith for reaching the world for Christ. Immediately after graduating I moved to Brooklyn and began my ministry &ndash; &ldquo;Christ To The Community Church.&rdquo; I had less than a dollar in my pocket and A Christian friend rented me a basement apartment with the first month&rsquo;s rent free. With no money, no furniture and no food I just went out to reach out to my community. I often thought about part in the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s  Prayer&rdquo; that says &ldquo;give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo; For me it was a very literal prayer.</p>
      <p>Joseph&rsquo;s parents were confused by him but his brothers also gave him a hard time. They considered killing him and then sold him to the Midianite. Gen. 37: 28 &ndash; &ldquo;So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.&rdquo; He was betrayed by his brothers, the ones who should be the closest to him. Some of my Christian brothers in the ministry began to oppose the work I was doing with the needy. My friends evicted me from my apartment and for 2 months I was as homeless as the people I&rsquo;m ministering to. Chuck Swindol once said&ndash;&ldquo;the Christian army is the only one that shoots its wounded.&rdquo; In spire of all this the Lord opened a door for me and I found a storefront to continue the ministry. My &ldquo;live by faith&rdquo; training carried me to press on for the lost. I slept in the back of the store and still had no personal income. In the midst of his trials Joseph still continued to live for God and the Lord gave him favor with Potiphar. Gen. 39: 3, 4 &ndash; &ldquo;When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD gave him success in everything he did, Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant.&rdquo; In the midst of my trials the Lord continued to bless me. Our little church began to grow and the Lord gave me my wonderful wife &ndash; Margie. We were blessed in our storefront ministry even as Joseph was blessed in his master&rsquo;s house.</p>
      <p>Then it hits Joseph again. His master&rsquo;s wife attempts to seduce him and then lies about him to her husband. Back on the shelf again. Joseph gets thrown into prison. As our ministry progressed our landlord evicted us from the storefront and then we moved around from place to place. Here I am on the shelf.</p>
      <p>Then Joseph finds favor with the warden and he was sure things will change for the best. Gen. 39:21 - &ldquo;The LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.&rdquo; So he&rsquo;s in prison but he still finds God&rsquo;s favor. Verse 23 says &ldquo;The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.&rdquo; In the midst of our eviction two years later we found the favor of God. We were contact by the elders of Salem Gospel Tabernacle in our community. They called a member&rsquo;s meeting. Their members voted me in as the pastor. They voted our board as their board and our members as their members. That church turned their work over to us as we merged the ministries as &ldquo;Sunset Park Community Church.&rdquo; The pastor turned over the church keys to us and then most of the members moved away.</p>
      <p>Then Joseph interprets the dreams of the imprisoned baker and cupbearer. He asks the cupbearer to tell Pharaoh about his dilemma. Gen. 40:14 &ndash; &ldquo;But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.&rdquo; Joseph is thinking Pharaoh would find out about him and vindicate him. He&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;s home free. I&rsquo;m thinking God&rsquo;s favor is upon me and now my faith filled vision is going to be accomplished. He again is forgotten by the cupbearer who was supposed to help him. Stuck &ldquo;on the shelf&rdquo; for another 2 years (Gen. 41:1). Just when he thought he&rsquo;d be free he&rsquo;s still again lost in prison.</p>
      <p>Just when I thought all is well a moving school bus zooms into the intersection I&rsquo;m walking. As Joseph was not executed but placed into a prison it seems that I could have gone home to the Lord but He spared me and sustained my life.</p>
      <p>Now I can learn from the outcome of Joseph&rsquo;s life. I&rsquo;m waiting on God for total restoration&ndash;physically, cognitively and spiritually. He  came through for Joseph and has reserved Joseph to fulfill His plan. I know God is coming through for me and whatever His plan is for my ongoing life I&rsquo;m waiting for His restoration! Perhaps these 2 years since my accident gets me off the shelf.</p>
      <p>When he meets his bro&shy;thers again Joseph tells them &ldquo;You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.&rdquo; (Gen. 50:20) Paul tells us that same thing in Romans - ROM 8:28&ndash; &ldquo;And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>I don&rsquo;t understand why? or for what? I just keep looking to Him! Since God has placed me &ldquo;on the shelf&rdquo; like Joseph I&rsquo;m learning from Joseph&rsquo;s faithfulness to God and keep looking to the Lord for my solution. </p>
      <p>Paul told Timothy &ldquo;&hellip;I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:12b)</p>
      <p>Joseph was only 17 when his brothers betrayed him, it took 13 years until his promotion from God. He never gave up &ndash; he persisted in spite of the circumstances. We need to hang on and keep our eyes on Him just as the writer to the Hebrews exhorts us - &ldquo;Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith&hellip;&rdquo; (Hebrews 12:2).</p>
