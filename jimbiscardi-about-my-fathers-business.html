            <h4>I Must Be About My Father&rsquo;s<br>
              Business - Jesus            </h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Jim Biscardi Jr. </p>
          </div>
            
            <p align="center">Not only is Jesus our Savior and  Lord, He&rsquo;s also the CEO of Father&rsquo;s business. He produces fine, living  products, and supplies unique services to unbelievers and believers who are  among His customers. </p>
            <p>We  were once lost and condemned to death because of sin.&nbsp; His service to us was that He took upon  Himself our sins, and paid that penalty. He rose from the dead.&nbsp; And all who accept Him and His sacrifice for  us are said to be &ldquo;born again&rdquo;, and become part of God&rsquo;s forever family. (John  1:11-13).</p>
            <p>As  we believers walk with Christ in this new life, and submit to His ways instead  of our ways, by obeying His Word, we go through the process of sanctification.  This means being separated from worldly appetites and desires, and being  separated unto God for His work (John 17:16-19). So the &ldquo;product&rdquo; Jesus offers  to believers is a new <strong>you</strong> and <strong>me</strong>.(2 Corinthians 5:17). </p>
            <p>Jesus  says that He has come to serve, not to be served. (Matthew 20:28). And that the  greatest in His kingdom is the servant of all &ndash; that&rsquo;s Him. (Mark 9:35).&nbsp; So there are a number of services He offers  to believers.&nbsp; Here are just a few:</p>
            <p>First,  He knows how hard it is to maintain our lives pure and holy, so He asks us to  surrender that job to Him. (Romans 12:1-2). He wants, as it were, for us to  sign the deed of our heart &mdash; which has now become His home &mdash; over to Him;  rather than just making Him a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; there! Then it becomes His job to  maintain this new life for us, and we find that we can do all things through  Christ who strengthens us. (Philippians 4:13). We call this service &ldquo;accepting  Jesus as Lord of our lives.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>We  surrender to Him any rights we thought we had, and in return He gives us  heavenly treasures as well as all we need on earth. More than we can ever think  about or imagine becomes our inheritance. (Matthew 6:33; 1Corinthians 2:9)</p>
            <p>Second,  Jesus sets us into a group of believers to be built up and contribute to  building up others. He makes us servants of one another. (Galatians 5:13). He  does this to give us real life and worth and to give it more abundantly! (John  10:10). As Jesus washed the feet of His disciples, He offers that ministry to  us as well. So we who are Christians become servants to one another, which  gives us &ldquo;meat&rdquo; to eat that most unbelievers can&rsquo;t comprehend. It&rsquo;s the meat of  doing God&rsquo;s will and finishing the work He&rsquo;s given us to do. (John 4:34). </p>
            <p>We  find that we are in a battle together &mdash; living this Christian life &mdash; and we  need one another. We are dependent upon God and each other. The life is not  just &ldquo;Jesus and me&rdquo; but a life lived out in a corporate body, where the  objective is to glorify God and become one with brothers and sisters in the  Christian family (Acts 2:42-47). In God&rsquo;s kingdom [or business], fellow Christians  become internal customers of one another re&shy;ceiving Jesus&rsquo; provision through  other believers.</p>
            <p>Third,  Jesus empowers believers to lovingly witness to the world [those who have not  yet accepted His product or services] by giving us the baptism of the Holy  Spirit. John the Baptist spoke about this service when he said of Jesus, &ldquo;I  indeed baptize you with water, but . . . He will baptize you with the Holy  Spirit and with fire&rdquo; (Luke 3:16). </p>
            <p>Jesus  told His disciples to wait in Jerusalem, after He ascended into heaven, &ldquo;until  you are endued with power from on high&rdquo; (Luke 24:49). &ldquo;Wait for the promise of  the Father, which, He said, you have heard from Me. For John truly baptized  with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from  now. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and  you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to  the end of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:4, 5, 8).</p>
            <p>In  other words, Jesus empowers believers to go make more disciples. Thus,  unbelievers become external customers who need to be informed about the product  and services Jesus is providing.</p>
            <p>Every  believer has cus&shy;to&shy;mers, internal or external to our church, family,  workplace, or other venues. All of us should identify who our customers are  [those we are serving] and work toward delighting them. Your customer is the  one who receives your product or service and who can make or break your  enterprise. In profit-making companies, it&rsquo;s the one who most affects the bottom  line.</p>
            <p>Another  service Christ provides is to develop in believers a heart for satisfying His  primary customer, our Heavenly Father, who sent Him. He does this by His  example &mdash; in word and deed. (Matthew 28: 18-20).&nbsp; His product, a new you and me, is made to  have a right relationship with the Father, and give Him glory.&nbsp; It was born in the heart of the Father from  the foundation of the world to send His Son to free mankind from the control of  sin. (Revelation 13:8).</p>
            <p>It  was also the Father to whom Jesus needed to present Himself, after His  resurrection from the dead, to have the Father certify that what He had done  satisfied that cause (John 20:17). Again it was His Father who said, &ldquo;This is  My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased&rdquo; (Matthew 3:17; 17:5).</p>
            <p>Even  as a boy, Jesus knew who He needed to satisfy. In a visit to Jerusalem with His  earthly parents, He separated Himself from them. They found Him in the temple  speaking to the religious leaders of the day. When they inquired what He was  doing, Jesus replied, &ldquo;Why is it that you sought Me? Did you not know that I  must be about My Father&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; (Luke 2:49).</p>
            <p>It  was being about His Father&rsquo;s business that characterized Jesus&rsquo; life and  ministry. Jesus taught us by example how to submit to the Father&rsquo;s will: &ldquo;Most  assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees  the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son does in like manner&rdquo; (John 5:19).  &ldquo;He who does not honor the Son also does not honor the Father who sent Him&rdquo;  (John 5:23). &ldquo;My Father is greater than I&rdquo; (John 14:28). </p>
            <p>Jesus  spoke of two homes that needed to be prepared &mdash; one by Him and one by us in  John 14:2, 23, respectively. The first was, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many  mansions . . . I go to prepare a place for you.&rdquo; The second was, &ldquo;If anyone  loves Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come  to him and make Our home with him.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>In  both cases, note the way Jesus lifts up His Father &mdash; His prime customer.  Remember the many times Jesus left His disciples to go to a private place to  pray to His Heavenly Father &mdash; perhaps to check how He was satisfying the  Father. Remember also Jesus&rsquo; prayer at Gethsemane, &ldquo;Father, if it is Your will,  remove this cup from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done&rdquo; (Luke  22:42). </p>
            <p>It  wasn&rsquo;t the spikes that held Jesus to the cross. It was His love for us sinners,  His desire to please His Father, and fulfill His purpose in Father&rsquo;s  business.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s embrace Christ&rsquo;s  services, identify our customers, serve them faithfully, and proactively be  about Father&rsquo;s business as well.</p>
