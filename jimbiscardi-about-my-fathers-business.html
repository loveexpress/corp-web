            <p>Gospel means &ldquo;good news.&rdquo; It starts back in the Garden of  Eden.&nbsp; God&ndash;The Father, The Word, and Holy  Spirit &ndash; One God in three persons - created man out of the dust of the earth,  and then created woman out of one of Adam&rsquo;s ribs. (Jn. 1:1; Gen. 2:7, 21-22). He  created them for fellowship with Himself and to give Him glory. He told the  sole residents of earth to enjoy all the pleasures of the Garden, and to  multiply, but not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because  if they did they would die. (Gen. 2:17).</p>
            <p>Now Satan had  been created way before that time as Lucifer, an angel who led the worship of  God in heaven.&nbsp; But he became corrupted  by his pride and declared that he would rise above God.&nbsp; And so he rebelled along with one-third of  the angels. (Is. 14:12-14; Rev.12:4).&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Of course, God  put down that rebellion and cast the devil and those angels to earth. They  would still have access to heaven at God&rsquo;s command (Job 1:6), but God would use  Satan to sift the earth of the wheat - those who would desire His plan for  their lives&ndash; and the chaff. (Matt. 3:12).</p>
            <p>In the Garden,  Satan appears as a serpent. He speaks to Eve and convinces her that the fruit of the tree  of the knowledge of good and evil is worth eating, even though God told her not  to eat it.&nbsp; The devil lied and told her  that God didn&rsquo;t really say that she would die if she ate of it. (Gen. 3: 4-5).  Adam was there too, and he didn&rsquo;t stop Eve. Instead, he also ate of the fruit.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>After eating  the fruit, Adam and Eve realized that they were naked, and they hid from  God.&nbsp; The Word of God &ndash; later to be known  as Jesus Christ - called to them as He walked in the Garden, &ldquo;Where are  you?&rdquo;&nbsp; When He found them, they confessed  that they had sinned against Him.&nbsp; Adam  blamed God for creating Eve.&nbsp; And Eve  blamed the serpent who tempted her. (Gen. 3: 7-13). </p>
            <p>They didn&rsquo;t  die physically right away. They lived for many hundreds of years, multiplying  the human race. But eventually, instead of living eternally as God had desired  for them, they died. Adam and Eve, however, did immediately die  spiritually.They could no longer enter God&rsquo;s kingdom. They had aligned  themselves with Satan. So God banned them from the Garden. (Gen. 3:22-24). And  He told Satan that the seed of the woman &ndash; a Redeemer - would one day crush his  head, and end his rebellious influence over man. (Gen.3:15).</p>
            <p>Sadly, that  spirit of rebellion entered the entire human race through the sin of Adam and  Eve. (Rom. 5:12). The bible calls that spirit The Old Man. (Eph. 4:22; Col.  3:9).&nbsp; It put man in bondage to sin &ndash; it  made it impossible for man not to sin, and, hence unable to enter God&rsquo;s kingdom  because &ldquo;the wages of sin is death.&rdquo; (Heb. 2:15; Rom. 6:23). As a result, we  &ldquo;all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.&rdquo; (Rom. 3:23).</p>
            <p>Because of His  love for humanity, however, God killed an animal (probably a lamb) and made  clothing to cover Adam and Eve. (Gen. 3:21).&nbsp;  This covering, from the blood of the lamb, represented what God would do  in time through a plan that He had already previously conceived from the  beginning. Because He is God Almighty, the Beginning and the Ending, He knows  the end from the beginning, and already knew how He would deal with this sin  problem. (Rev. 1:8).</p>
            <p>God Himself,  through the Word made flesh, Jesus Christ, would be sacrificed for the sins of  man. (Jn. 1:14).&nbsp; He would be the sinless  Lamb who would shed His blood for the sins of the world. God would enter a  virgin, and she would conceive and give birth to the God-man, called the Only  Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, who would not, like the rest of humanity, inherit  the sin from Adam &amp; Eve.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>God, Himself,  would pay the death penalty He had laid down for all who sin. It would be God&rsquo;s  gift by grace through faith in Christ.&nbsp;  &ldquo;The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo; (Is.  63:5; Rom.3:23; Eph. 2:8).&nbsp; Because God  conceived this from the beginning, Jesus is said to be the &ldquo;Lamb slain from the  foundation of the world,&rdquo; to redeem man from the bondage of sin and spending  eternity in the Lake of Fire. (Rev. 13:8).&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Those looking  ahead and believing in God&rsquo;s promise to send a Redeemer as well as those  looking back and believing in Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of the promise,  would be saved.</p>
            <p>In the  fullness of time, it happened just as God said it would.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit overshadowed a virgin, named  Mary, and she gave birth to Jesus. (Lk 1:35). The Word of God was made flesh,  and dwelt among us. (Jn 1:14).&nbsp; God, The  Son, had to be made like man in every way, in order that He might become a  merciful and faithful high priest (in the Jewish tradition) in service to God,  and that He might make atonement for the sins of the people. (Heb. 2:17).</p>
            <p>Even though He  showed Himself to be God by doing many miraculous signs, miracles, healings,  and deliverances, He was despised and rejected by the religious elite.&nbsp; On one occasion, Jesus even told them,  &ldquo;Before Abraham was, I am,&rdquo; (Jn. 8:58) indicating that He was The Beginning and  the Ending.&nbsp; Out of jealousy and fear,  they gave Him over to the Romans to be cruelly whipped, beaten, crucified, and  to die.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>But He allowed  Himself to endure all that for our benefit.&nbsp;  He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our wickedness. (Is.  53:4-5).&nbsp; He shared in our humanity so  that by His death, He might destroy him who held the power of death over man &ndash;  the devil &ndash; and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their  fear of death.&nbsp; (Heb. 2: 14-15).&nbsp; </p>
            <p>He bore our  sins as a substitute for us- &ldquo;upon Him was laid the iniquity of us all&rdquo; (Is.  53:6) - and He died on the cross as a sacrifice to God for our sin, and rose  from the dead to display His power over sin and death.&nbsp; And He showed Himself to as many as 500  people after His resurrection. (1Cor. 15:6).</p>
            <p>The result is  that in God&rsquo;s eyes all who receive Christ, He gives the ability to become His  children, not born of the flesh, or of the will of man, but born of God &ndash; that  is, born-again. (Jn 1: 12-13). The Old Man is crucified with Christ, and He  gives us His Holy Spirit.&nbsp; (Rom. 6:6; Jn.  14:17; 15:26). We are then &ldquo;new creations.&rdquo;&nbsp;  (2 Cor. 5:17). </p>
            <p>We are  translated from the kingdom of darkness and allies of the devil, and are  welcomed as children of God, and joint heirs with Christ, into the kingdom of  light. (Col. 1:13). He crowns us with love and compassion for He remembers that  we are dust. (Ps 103: 4).&nbsp; And as far as  the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. (Ps. 103:12,</p>
            <p>14). And because He lives, we shall live, rule, and reign  with Him forever! (Jn. 11:25-26; Rev. 22:5).</p>
            <p>Now that&rsquo;s  really good news!!&nbsp; </p>
