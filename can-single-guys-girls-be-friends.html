<div id="articlepic"><img src="images/guys-girls.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" /> </div>              <p>Last week I was rejoicing with one of my single  friends, Roman, because he believes he's found the girl he wants to marry.  Naturally I'm excited for him and I hope I can attend his wedding. I want all  my single friends to find mates.</p>
              <p>But I'm also disturbed because I know  many singles that would like to be married yet have very few close friends of  the opposite sex. Something is built into our Christian culture that  discourages normal guy/girl friendships. It's as if we're afraid they will hop  in bed if they actually talk for an hour and share their hopes, dreams or  struggles.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, we  pressure guys and girls to marry if they become friends. (&quot;Oooh, Gina, we saw you with Brad  yesterday. Is something go&shy;ing on between you two?&quot;) Why can't Gina and  Brad just encourage each other in their journey with God without turning their  relationship into a big deal? Is it possible for Christian guys and girls to  build healthy friendships without assuming they are headed to the church altar?</p>
              <p>I believe it is absolutely possible.  Here are six keys to developing these relationships:</p>
              <p><strong>1. View your friends as fa&shy;mily.</strong> Paul  told Timothy he should treat older women as mothers  and younger wo&shy;men as sisters (see 1 Tim. 5:2). The same rule applies to  girls: You should view your male Christian friends as brothers. Having this  pure-hearted attitude makes real friendship possible. If a guy views his female  friend as a sister he won't be lusting af&shy;ter her body; instead, his instinct  will be to encourage her. If a girl views her male friend as a brother she will  care about him and pray for him without expecting him to have sexual feelings  for her.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Avoid &quot;pair  pressure.&quot; </strong>In many churches today  there's a nagging pressure to find &quot;the one&quot; so  you can take yourself off the market. If you are carrying this burden, every  friendship with a person of the opposite sex can be a drain. &quot;Is she the  one?&quot; &quot;Does he like me?&quot; &quot;How should I dress?&quot; These  concerns morph into worries that suck all the fun out of life. Trust God with  your desire for a mate. If you don't relax you will come across as  desperate&mdash;and that's a big turn-off. Stop trying to make something happen and  just enjoy getting to know a new friend. Remember Psalm 37:4: &quot;Delight  yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.&quot;</p>
              <p><strong>3.Say goodbye to awkward.</strong> Before we married, my wife and I both dreaded  the dating scene. Calling someone you barely know and asking them to dinner or  a movie is scary&mdash;and it's the reason a lot of Christian guys are still single  at 35. Meanwhile Christian girls have been told to wait for the guy to make the  first move, so they are conditioned to wait for &quot;the call.&quot; You can  say goodbye to all this awkwardness by organizing group gatherings: Meet  several friends for coffee, invite them to a cookout or throw a party. Then  just enjoy each other's company. And girls: Feel free to initiate the  invitation!</p>
              <p><strong>4. Rediscover the art of conversation.</strong> In  today's media-soaked culture we've forgotten  how to talk to each other. Many guys feel socially clumsy, so they  become immersed in video games and become emotional hermits. They need  friends&mdash;including female friends&mdash;to help them  crawl out of their shells. Meanwhile both guys and girls are so addicted  to their phones that they don't know how to talk for an hour without checking  for text messages. If you want to be a good friend, learn to focus on the  person you're talking to!</p>
              <p><strong>5. Don't allow a hint of seduction.</strong> The  message we get from media today is that it's all about sex. But as a Christian  you don't have to bow to that idol. You can have a meaningful friendship with a  person of the opposite sex without ending up in bed together. But if you plan  to keep it pure, you will have to put up some obvious boundaries. Use common  sense. Don't wear revealing clothes. Don't touch each other inappropriately.  And don't spend the night at each other's apartments in the name of &quot;friendship.&quot; If you are true  friends you will respect each other enough to avoid a sexual mistake that you  will regret later.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Keep your friendships Christ-focused.</strong> Hebrews  3:13a says: &quot;But encourage one another day after day.&quot; This verse  applies to single men and women, too. We need each others' encouragement, and  God wants the single members of the church to be involved in each others'  lives. Your phone calls, notes and honest counsel may be what propels your  friend into their life purpose; your kindness and prayers may be what gets them  through a difficult crisis. Keep Jesus at the center of your friendships and  don't miss out on the blessing those friends can be to you.</p>
