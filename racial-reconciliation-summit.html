            </h4>
              <div id="authorname"><!--SECTION LEFT END-->
 </div>
              
              <p>When  Bishop Harry Jackson, chairman of the High Impact Leadership Coalition and se&shy;nior  pastor of Hope Christian Church in Washington, D.C., first called up Bishop  T.D. Jakes, one of America's favorite and most influential preachers and asked  him to be a part of a summit to heal America's racial divide, one of the first  emotions Jakes felt was fear.</p>
              <p>The senior  pastor of The Potter's House megachurch in Dallas, Texas, and New  York Times best-selling author says he was afraid because his faith in people  at that particular moment on matters of race had grown fragile. America was  tense. Protests over controversial police actions in Ferguson, Missouri, and  Staten Island, New York, were sweeping the country. Jakes just didn't know.  What if everything just went wrong?</p>
              <p>&quot;My faith in people was so fragile  that when Bishop Jackson called me I said, 'Man,  I'm scared. If this doesn't go right, I just don't know,'&quot; he  confessed during an evening service at his  church hours after a diverse coalition of influential pastors and  Christian faith leaders had met for the summit called &quot;Healing the Racial  Divide&quot; on Thursday night &mdash; the birthday of civil rights icon Dr. Martin  Luther King Jr.</p>
              <p>&quot;I stood on the edge of struggling  with losing my faith. Not my faith in God, but my faith in people,&quot; Jakes  confessed. &quot;I wondered to myself, how long will we cry out and be told  we're whining? How long will we offer simple Christian clich&eacute;s to complicated,  complex sociological situations? How long will we major on the minor and be  pitted against each other to the demise of a society that desperately needs  somebody to speak for them?&quot;</p>
              <p>All that wondering stop&shy;ped for Jakes on  Thursday.</p>
              <p>&quot;My faith in God never shook but  I'm so happy to&shy;night,&quot; said Jakes after a powerful and poignant meeting  that many who attended saw as progress among faith leaders.</p>
              <p>R.A. Vernon, founder and senior pastor  of The Word Church in Cleveland, declared: &quot;I almost teared up as I thought to myself, Bishop Jakes  mentioned the fact that he had no idea, neither did Harry Jackson that they  were planning this on Dr. King's birthday. But might I suggest Bishop Jakes,  that was not happenstance or chance, God maneuvered this moment because what  other birthday present to give Dr. King than to bring truth to his  vision.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;It was Dr. King who said that 'the  most segregated hour of the week is the 11 o'clock hour on Sunday morning, and  today I sat there and saw not only Bi&shy;shop Jakes, but Bishop Paul Morton,  pastor Tony Evans, John Hagee &hellip; and one of our Hispanic homiletic heroes,  pastor (Samuel) Rodriguez. I said to myself, this is what heaven is going to  look like &mdash; all these pastors, beautiful white, black and Hispanic brothers,&rdquo; he added.</p>
              <p>An earlier  release from the event's organizers had anticipated a crowd of about 75 leaders  but Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, who  also participated in the meeting, said it was at least twice that figure.</p>
              <p>&quot;About  150 to 200 (people),&quot; he estimated. &quot;It was a large crowd.&quot;</p>
              <p>In that crowd  were people like Leith Anderson, president of the National Association of  Evangelicals; Bernice King, CEO of The King Center in Atlanta and daughter of  Martin Luther King Jr.; Alveda King, minister, civil rights activist and niece  of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National  Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, and Andrew Young, former congressman  and U.N. ambassador.</p>
              <p>For Perkins,  racial reconciliation had long been a major concern. In 2008, the year Barack  Obama was elected as the first African-American President of the United States,  Perkins co-authored a book with Bishop Jackson called Personal Faith, Public  Policy.</p>
              <p>&quot;And one  of the issues we talked about was racial re&shy;conciliation and how the church has  to be at the center of that. Nothing else is going to unify our country and  culture,&quot; said Perkins.</p>
              <p>Racial  reconciliation, however, was not a priority for faith leaders at the time, he  said. But from what he saw at the gathering on Thursday, faith leaders appear  to be thinking about it now.</p>
              <p>&quot;Back  then there was no sense of urgency. But after Ferguson and after New York,  there's a sense of urgency that our nation is coming apart racially and  ethnically. And so, that was the genesis behind this gathering and, quite  frankly, it was encouraging to see the diversity and the breadth of leaders  that came together to discuss this issue, which tells me it is very much at the  forefront of concern across racial, denominational and ethnic lines,&quot; said  Perkins.</p>
              <p>The meeting  focused on seven &quot;Bridges to Peace&quot; community initiatives namely:  reconciliation and prayer forums; education policy reform; community engagement forums; community service and compassion outreaches;  personal, marriage and family development; engagement with the criminal justice  system; and economic development strategies.</p>
              <p>&quot;Underserved  communities and minorities needed to see that when our blood runs down the  street that the church, not the Latino church, not the black church, I hate  those terms anyway, but the blood-washed church&hellip; gathering strength together  and come and sit down and hear and listen and talk,&quot; said Jakes.</p>
              <p>&quot;The  media for too long has pitted us against each other, divided us for the ratings it could create by the conflict. Appealing to our deepest fears and our greatest  woes, and I hated that people I knew casually would learn about my people through the news  rather than to walk across the street and have a sandwich,&quot; said Jakes.</p>
              <p>&quot;But I  serve notice on all the forces of hell. Today we walked across the street and  we sat down together and we had a conversation that I have never heard before.  And every blood-washed born-again spirit-filled child of the King ought to be  happy in Jesus tonight. They ought to be shouting for victory to&shy;night,&quot;  said Jakes.</p>
              <p>&quot;You see,  I believe that the church could not answer the call to reconcile the world  until the church reconciled itself but there is hope in the city tonight, there  is joy in the city tonight, there is peace in the city tonight. I want the  church to at least be as good as the paramedics are. When the paramedics come,  they come without regard to color or culture or language or ethnicity,&quot; he  said.</p>
              <p>Jim Garlow, of  Skyline Church in San Diego, California, testified that when he got the  invitation to attend the summit the Lord told him to be &quot;silent.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;You  don't have any knowledge about what you're about to hear,&quot; he said God  told him. &quot;Don't you talk, you listen. All of us had microphones in front  of us. In the meeting all day today, I never touched it because the Holy Spirit  said: 'You be silent. You've come to learn. You don't know about what you're  hearing, you listen and you learn from them. That's why I came, I didn't know I  was going to be on a microphone tonight at that point. I had no idea,  especially standing in front of Bishop T.D. Jakes, the fourth member of the  Trinity,&quot; he quipped as the audience erupted with laughter.</p>
              <p>But it was  what he said and did shortly after making that statement that became somewhat  of a highlight of the night.</p>
              <p>&quot;Bishop  Jakes made a statement today. When he said it, I can't describe how it shook  me. He said all these years, I've gone, every time pastors call &mdash; he was  referring to white pastors, when they call I go, when they say come let's  gather, I go. I always go. We go, we go, we go. But he said, not 'til this  day.' He said, 'I'm 57 years of age,' and he said, 'not 'til this day, have I  seen a gathering of white pastors coming to us on this day,'&quot; Garlow  recalled.</p>
              <p>&quot;And I  want to say &hellip; Bi&shy;shop, I want to say to you, we repent of that. I was shocked  by that. That's a scandal that should not be permitted to go on, and I want to  publicly ask your forgiveness on behalf of people like me &mdash; that we did not  come to you, you had to wait until this day, this is too long to wait, but we  are here, thank you sir,&quot; he ended. He then went over to Bishop Jakes and  both men embraced in forgiveness.</p>
