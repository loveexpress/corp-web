            <p>Have you ever wondered what judgment day  for us Christians will be like? After the Rapture, we <em>&ldquo;must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.&rdquo;</em> 2 Corinthians  5:10. <strong>Knowing how we&rsquo;ll be measured in  that future day will help us live now with a view toward eternity, and fulfill  God&rsquo;s plan for our lives. </strong>Here&rsquo;s a vision I received concerning what this  Judgment Seat of Christ might be all about?</p>
            <p>I  was launched into a heavenly realm where I stood with ten thousand times ten  thousand and thousands of thousands. They were from <em>&ldquo;every kindred, tongue, people, and nation.&rdquo;</em> Revelation 5:9. In the  midst of these vast numbers of people stood a Judgment Seat and there in all  His glory was Christ, Himself. All the people (including me) praised Him and  the sound of our cheers was deafening.</p>
            <p>Then  something very strange happened. Jesus <em>looked</em> at me. It seemed that the Lord&rsquo;s eye caught the eye of everyone at the same  time. It was probably like what happened to Peter when Jesus <em>&ldquo;looked at him.&rdquo; </em>Luke 22:61. The noise  of the crowd seemed to hush and I could only see Christ&rsquo;s eye. The Lord&rsquo;s look only  lasted a moment, but it seemed like a lifetime. I&rsquo;d experienced be&shy;ing  heart-to-heart with the Lord, but now we were eye-to-eye.</p>
            <p>I  was lifted to spiritual heights unknown to me. I saw a stability - beyond the  tallest of earth&rsquo;s mountains; a strength - beyond the combined force of the  wind and ocean during a violent storm; a purity - beyond the smallest of  infants; a peace - beyond the most tranquil wa- ters; a deep, genuine care and  concern - beyond a mo&shy;ther&rsquo;s love for her nursing child; a joy - beyond a  father who receives back his rebellious son; and a hope - beyond the runner  about to pass the finish line first.</p>
            <p>With  that look, the Lord searched to see His own image in me. But I began to see  myself reflected back to me - certain opportunities I had missed to share the  Gospel or to emulate Christ; and times when I worked for Christ in my own  strength instead of His. Tears flowed over my face as I viewed these things  because I saw them being burned up like wood, hay, and stubble. 1 Corinthians  3:11-15.</p>
            <p>Then  my eyes, as if controlled by a source outside myself, viewed more and more of  the Lord&rsquo;s face - not just His eye. When I caught a glimpse of His mouth, the  Lord began to smile with such warmth that my tears were dried up instantly and  I began to feel a certain glow about me. He said, <em>&ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant.&rdquo;</em> Matthew 25:23. Then the  Lord called me by a new name that He said came from surrendering my &ldquo;self life&rdquo;  to serve Jesus and others. Revelation 2:17; Romans 12:1-2.</p>
            <p>Then  the Lord set me at the bottom of an inverted pyramid with rejoicing people whom  I knew during my lifetime arranged along the sides and top of the pyramid. The  Lord then began to tell me what happened to them. The Lord began, &ldquo;Do you  remember this lady who was on the bus, who was almost ready to deny My  existence? You ran after her, witnessed to her, and she received Me there in  the parking lot. Do you remember? She became a Sunday school teacher and led  many children to accept Me also.&rdquo; And as He spoke, those children - that I&rsquo;d  never met - were added to the pyramid.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Remember  this young man in your singles group who became a pastor? He planted churches  in the inner city and made disciples who also went on to bring My gospel to  many others.&rdquo; When He said that, more people that I&rsquo;d never met were added and  the pyramid of rejoicing people got even bigger. The Lord said, &ldquo;Do your  remember these sixty people who accepted Me during the lay witness mission that  you led? They each brought one more to Me.&rdquo; And more people were add&shy;ed to the  pyramid.</p>
            <p>The  Lord continued to tell me about the young soldier, who I helped find his way  back to Christ; all the members of my Sunday school classes, workshops, and  seminars. There were many that I had touched in some way unawares - some were  children of parents I helped stay together - others were people I prayed for  unceasingly, not knowing any of the results.</p>
            <p>As  I looked at all the rejoicing people in the pyramid above me, I remembered what  the Apostle <em>Paul told the Thessalonians,  &ldquo;For what is our hope, or joy, or <strong>crown  of rejoicing</strong>? Are not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at  His coming? For you are our glory and joy.&rdquo;</em> 1 Thessalonians 2:19-20. I  realized that the Lord had created a crown of rejoicing people all around me!</p>
            <p>When  the Lord finished speaking with me, I noticed that I was not at the very bottom  of this crown. Esther, the woman who led me to Christ, was under me. I was only  a small part of her crown. Under her was another, and another further down, and  that continued further and further downward. At the very bottom of the pyramid,  with an uncountable number in the crown, was Christ. He had the greatest and  largest crown! He said, &ldquo;Do you remember when I told you that if you would be  the greatest in My kingdom, you should be the servant of all?&rdquo; Mark 9:35.</p>
            <p>I  told you, <em>&lsquo;Whosoever desires to be first  among you, let him be your slave, just as the Son of Man did not come to be  served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.&rdquo;</em> Matthew  20:27-28. I realized that Jesus was First and Last - that He was the Source as  well as the Finish Line of my faith. But there was something even below Christ.  I realized, after a while of straining to see, that at the very bottom of the  crown was the image of a broken heart - it was the Father&rsquo;s broken heart. But  His heart was now healed!</p>
            <p>Suddenly,  I felt another crown upon my head and the Lord said, &ldquo;Behold your hope, and  joy, and crown of rejoicing. Are not these people, to whom you ministered, who  are now in My presence, your hope, joy, and crown?&rdquo; Then without delay I cast  that crown at the Lord&rsquo;s feet and these words fell effortlessly from my lips, <em>&ldquo;You alone are worthy, O Lord, to receive  the glory and honor and power.&rdquo;</em> Revelation 4:10-100. Immediately the space  around me became brilliant with light -transfiguration light! Mark 9:2-3. And I  remembered what Daniel had said, <em>&ldquo;They  that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever.&rdquo;</em> Daniel 12:3.</p>
            <p>After  seeing this vision, I rededicated my life to Christ. I asked forgiveness for  not using every opportunity the Lord had given me to share Christ with others.  I asked forgiveness for the times I&rsquo;d lived by flesh, rather than living by  faith and trust in Christ. I wanted more than ever before to tell people about  Him - His stability, strength, purity, love, joy, peace, and hope - to tell  Christians about their glorious appointment with Him at the Judgment Seat and  the crown of rejoicing.</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cling to the old rugged cross, and  exchange it someday for a crown.&rdquo;</em> - George Bennard.</p>
