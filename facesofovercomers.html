              <p>How do  you rise above something that keeps getting  bigger? How do you leave something in the past that is not going to go away?  How do you keep fighting when you know your opponent is probably going to win?  How do you overcome something that can&rsquo;t be overcome?</p>
              <p>We were a  young married couple. We had beautiful children. We were suc- cessful.&nbsp; We were happy. By all measures, we were  blessed.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>I was a  busy actor, working in Movies, TV and Commercials. Charlene was starting a new  career as a Casting Director. We weren&rsquo;t just  happy we were secure.&nbsp; Secure in our  careers. Secure financially. Secure in our love&hellip; Life couldn&rsquo;t get any better.  Then&hellip; I was diagnosed with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, an incurable progressively  debilitating neurological disorder. I was barely 30. Publicly, I put my head  firmly in the sand and kept on living.&nbsp;  Ignoring the illness. Working as much as possible. Not telling anyone.  All the while the disease progressed. But after nearly a decade of outrunning  Par&shy;kinson&rsquo;s the disease caught up with me. Almost all at once, I stopped  getting hired and had to go on disability. Just for added intrigue this was  2008 and the Wall Street markets crashed. I went from having everything I ever  wanted to having almost everything taken away. Almost everything.</p>
              <p>The  lowest and darkest moment came on July 3rd 2009 when on a family outing, our  minivan door slammed shut on Charlene&rsquo;s head&hellip; hard.&nbsp; At the hospital, she didn&rsquo;t know where she  was, or who she was or why she was there. The doctor was very concerned and  asked me to take my kids out of the hospital, not wanting them to be there if  the worst were to occur. We were four hours from home so I had no one to care  for the kids, for me. I remember taking my young and terrified children out of the hospital and leaving their mother, the  love of my life, lying on a gurney.</p>
              <p>I prayed.  I begged. I cried. </p>
              <p>It took  almost a year.&nbsp; A year of sitting in a  dark room whispering to each other before Charlene was back to some semblance  of normal. But just as she was feeling better, my Parkinson&rsquo;s medication was  losing its effectiveness.&nbsp; I was falling,  I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and I was having trouble breathing.&nbsp; I was taking seven medications and 19 pills  per day.&nbsp; My doctors recommended brain  surgery.</p>
              <p>As I lay  on the gurney Charlene cried and prayed for me.&nbsp;  When they wheeled me in, I asked for a second and I prayed.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Our  Father in heaven</p>
              <p>Hallowed  be thy name</p>
              <p>Thy  Kingdom come</p>
              <p>Thy will  be done&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&hellip; I  stopped. I thought I&rsquo;m just going to leave it there.  I told the doctors I was ready. And I am. Our future won&rsquo;t be easy.  Parkinson&rsquo;s and life will make sure of that&hellip; But we&rsquo;re ready and His will be  done. And with Him, we&rsquo;ll continue to overcome.</p>
              <p>(Join  Jeremy Camp and 24 other speakers and hundreds of believers like Joe and  Charlene at this year's Collyde Summit 2014 at Christ Church in Rockaway on Sep  19 and 20. Don't miss this amazing conference: www.collydesummit. com. 2014  theme is &quot;Overcome&quot;)</p>
              <p>Collyde, today, has three initiatives  (to learn more, see www.collyde.org), but the one that we are really excited  for in 2014 is the Collyde Summit. The Collyde Summit is a gathering of  passionate believers in the New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania area, who love Jesus and are convicted to become world  changers. <strong>Collyde Summit 2014</strong> will  be taking place <strong>Sept. 19th </strong>and <strong>20th</strong> at <strong>Christ</strong> <strong>Church</strong> in Rockaway,  NJ. We anticipate 1200 believers and this year, for the first time, the Collyde  Summit is kicking-off four specialized tracks for attendees, of all ages and  interests, to choose from: Leadership Essentials, Creative Arts &amp; Media,  Worship Experience and Justice, Culture &amp; Redemption. </p>
              <p>We will  be joined by ar&shy;tist, singer, and songwriter, <strong>Jeremy</strong> <strong>Camp</strong> and some of  our speakers include <strong>Dr. Da&shy;vid</strong> <strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>Rebekah Ly&shy;ons</strong>, <strong>Tim</strong> <strong>Lucas</strong>, <strong>Naomi Zacha&shy;rias</strong>, <strong>Eugene</strong> <strong>Cho</strong>, <strong>Brad</strong> <strong>Lo&shy;me&shy;nick</strong> and many others. To  register, go to collydesummit.com</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Overcome&rdquo; is this year&rsquo;s theme,  based off Jesus&rsquo; words of preparation to His disciples, in John 16:33, before  His death and resurrection. &ldquo;In this world you will have trouble, but take  heart! I have overcome the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;  Collyde&rsquo;s story is one of Overcome and the truth is, we all have stories  of Overcome. What&rsquo;s yours?</p>
