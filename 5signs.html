              <p >With the  divorce rate in the church matching the  world's, I thought I would offer this fresh reminder to single wo&shy;men  considering serious relationships. I've seen a lot of heartache from women who  didn't listen to leaders who advised them not to marry. From the pattern of  divorces, these are the five red flags I've  seen women ignore when marrying the wrong guy.</p>
              
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>#1: He has no interest</strong> <strong>in God.</strong></p>
<p>I've been amazed at how many women ignore this ba&shy;sic  warning sign. But I think this sign is ignored because they are desperate for  male attention or looking for a father they  never had. Don't get me wrong&mdash;he may seem like he is interested in God  for a season ... until he gets you down the aisle. Then prepare for  Sunday-morning battles when he would rather go to a sports activity than go to  church.</p>
              
              <p>Marriage  is not an opportunity to evangelize, nor is it an outreach activity. God takes  marriage so seriously that He states that you can't be unequally yoked:  &quot;Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and  wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with  darkness?&quot; (2 Cor. 6:14 NIV)</p>
              
              <p>Besides making  the decision to follow Christ, getting married  is the most important decision you'll ever make in your life. </p>
              
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>#2: Your leaders or pastors think marrying him  is a bad idea.</strong></p>
              
              <p>I've seen marriages take place despite warnings from  leaders. In most cases, the marriages ended in divorce or they are hanging by a  thread. When my husband, Jerome, asked me to marry him, I asked several leaders  for their advice. I also asked about his character. Every leader gave my future  fianc&eacute; a rave review and spoke highly of his integrity, faithfulness and loyalty. Their review was a sign  that he was &quot;the one&quot; for me.</p>
              
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>#3: Your parents</strong> <strong>don't like him.</strong></p>
<p>My mom  use to tell me how much her parents hated my dad. Well, he was a 29-year-old  man who enticed a 15-year-old girl into marrying him against her parents'  wishes! Of course they were going to hate his guts. She wished many years later  she would have listened to her parents.</p>
              
              <p>My  grandparents were not Christians, but I believe God gives parents a radar for  men who don't have the best motives for their daughters. When my mom met Je&shy;rome,  she instantly liked him. Jerome won my parents' hearts and approval for  marrying me. That was the second sign that Jerome was &quot;the one&quot; for  me.</p>
              
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>#4: He doesn't have a job or can't hold one  down.</strong></p>
              
              <p>I had a  guy pay for my dinner with food stamps. Although he was a Christian, this was a  sign from God he was not a candidate for a serious  relationship. If you have to pay your own way in the relationship or  help him out financially because he can't hold down a job, he is not a  candidate for marriage. He may speak in tongues and read the Bible, but if he  can't hold down a job, this is a red flag about his character.</p>
              
              <p>One of my  friends met a guy in the unemployment office.  I told her I didn't think the unemployment office was the best place to  meet a guy. She dated him but ended the relationship  because he wasn't employed.</p>
              
              <p>The Bible  says if you don't work, you don't eat. Having  a work ethic is a must for someone you're considering for marriage:  &quot;For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: 'The one who is  unwilling to work shall not eat.'&quot; (2 Thess. 3:10)</p>
              
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>#5: He has an addiction.</strong></p>
              
              <p>A friend  of mine married someone who struggled with online pornography. She didn't know  he struggled with this until they were years into their marriage with several  children. He wouldn't go for counseling, and they eventually divorced.</p>
              
              <p>A man who  is addicted to pornography, drugs or li&shy;quor is not a candidate for marriage.  He may tell you he plans to get counseling or wants God to set him free&mdash;because that's what you want to hear. But  until he is free from that addiction, he is not &quot;the one.&quot;</p>
              
              <p>I plead  with you to not compromise on these standards. I've seen so much heartache in  families with women marrying against the counsel of wise leaders or marrying  someone with an addiction. Listen to your leaders  and parents. And above all, don't pay his way. He is not &quot;the one.&quot;</p>
