            <h4 id="articleTitle">What is Revival and Why <br>
              Do We Need It?<br>
            </h4>
              <div id="authorname">by Daniel P. Buttafuoco Esq.
<!--SECTION LEFT END-->
              </div>
              <p>The  word &ldquo;revival&rdquo; is not to be found in either the NIV or the KJV translations of  the Bible. The closest English word to revival in the Bible is the word  &ldquo;revive&rdquo; from which the word &ldquo;revival&rdquo; is derived and it is found in Psalm  85:6. That Psalm is a &ldquo;communal prayer for the renewal of God&rsquo;s mercies to his  people at a time when they are once more suffering from distress.&rdquo; It is a  prayer of restoration, in part, as follows:</p>
              </span>
  <p><span class="articlecredits">Restore  us again, O God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.<br>
    Will  you be angry with us forever?<br>
    Will  you prolong your anger through all generations?<br>
    <strong>Will you not revive us again, that your  people may rejoice in you?</strong>(Psalms  85:4-6; NIV, emphasis mine)</span></p>
  <span class="bodytxt">
  <p>According  to these verses, revival is for God&rdquo;s people (i.e. the Church). While revival  often has the connotation of camp meetings and evangelical success in winning  new converts, in reality, revival is defined as &ldquo;the act or process of  bringing...back to life.&rdquo; It is not creating new life out of thin air, nor is  it bringing to life inanimate matter since that was never alive to begin with.  Rather, revival connotes the idea of returning to a state of life what once was  alive but which since has died.</p>
  <p>When  looking at the pathetic state of some churches and the miserable condition of  the lives of many so called believers it is easy to see why revival is needed.  All recent statistics indicate that the lifestyle differences between people  claiming to be followers of Christ (&ldquo;Christians&rdquo;) and non-believers is  virtually non-existent. Thus, when it comes to divorce, abortion, criminality,  pre-marital and extra-marital sex, lying, cheating and stealing, there is  little observable difference between &ldquo;the world&rdquo; and &ldquo;the church.&rdquo; Is it any  wonder that our testimony as believers is bankrupt in the eyes of society?</p>
  <p>My  facsimile edition of Websters 1828 American Dictionary of the English Language  defines revival as &ldquo;renewed and more active attention to religion [i.e.  Christianity]; an awakening of men [and women] to their spiritual concerns.&rdquo; In  light of the statistically demonstrated lack of character in the Church,  mentioned above, is there any doubt that we need revival now more than ever? We  desperately need more active attention to the matters of our faith and an  awakening to spiritual concerns for the sake of Christ who purchased us for  himself at great cost. The clear teachings of the Bible in which we are called  to serve our God for his good purpose and pleasure have been replaced by a  self-centered &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; message, taught by many popular preachers of &ldquo;what can  God do for me lately.&rdquo; It is a terrible tragedy of modern American Christianity  that the Christ centered message of the cross has been reduced to a  man-centered appeal to the basest desires of human nature, in the name of  &ldquo;faith.&rdquo; We need a revival and we need it now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  church is in need of perennial revival because of recurrent spiritual decline.&rdquo;  Just as the Israelites in the Book of Judges went from captivity, to miraculous  deliverance, to praising God, to apostasy and idolatry and then back to  captivity, only to have the cycle repeated shamelessly over and over, the  Church suffers the same fate in a similar cyclical fa&shy;shion. It is the problem  of human nature (&ldquo;carnal nature&rdquo; in the NIV; the &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; in the KJV) which,  when not suppressed, causes believers to gradually grow cold to the rigorous  demands of true Christian living and to slow&shy;ly but surely forsake the commands  of Christ. This is sometimes described as &ldquo;losing one&rsquo;s first love [for  Christ].&rdquo; Love is a verb, however; an action word.&nbsp; Jesus said &ldquo;if you love me, keep my  commandments (John 14:15).&rdquo; Yes, Christ&rsquo;s commandments are often difficult but  we are not without the help of the Holy Spirit (&ldquo;helper&rdquo;) to assist us daily in  this regard. We are commanded in scripture to &ldquo;find out what pleases the Lord  (Eph. 5:10)&ldquo; and, of course, to do it!</p>
  <p>I  often teach my Bible students that it is easy to become a Christian but hard to  become a disciple. By that I mean that Christ has made it easy for us to obtain  forgiveness of our sins (it&rsquo;s all him!) but it is hard to emulate the  self-sacrifice of Christ (and his earliest followers, for that matter). Self-indulgent  fashionable &ldquo;gos&shy;pels&rdquo; that &ldquo;tickle the ears&rdquo; of the public to &ldquo;name it and  claim it&rdquo; do not help in this regard. Perhaps it is exactly because we teach  that Christ&rsquo;s forgiveness is so easy and cheap that believers today feel they  can neglect prayer and spiritual disciplines and just &ldquo;run to the altar&rdquo; for a  quick and easy repentance. That is dangerous living, my friends! Christ calls  us to holiness and, the longer you have known him and had his fellowship, the  higher the standard. If you are a believer you will manifest the spiritual  fruits listed in Galations 5:22: &ldquo;love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,  goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.&rdquo; Against such character  traits there is no need for law!</p>
  <p>In a  genuine revival, Christ and not the human self, not the celebrity prea&shy;chers  and not anything else has the pre-eminence. When we focus on ourselves we  inevitably return to apostasy. When we focus on Christ, we are &ldquo;on fire&rdquo; and  revival erupts. Why else does the Church always prosper amidst the fires of  severe persecution? Why did the early Church explode in the face of severe  recriminations including torture and martyrdom? The answer is simply because  they had no choice but to shift their fo&shy;cus from themselves onto Christ who is  worth more than everything this world has to offer.</p>
  <p>We  here in the spoiled rotten self-centered American Church need revival more now  than at anytime in history. It&rsquo;s not about us, it&rsquo;s about him. Revive us, O  Lord!</p>
  <p>The  word &ldquo;revival&rdquo; derives from the Latin word &ldquo;revivere&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;to live again.&rdquo;  In the context used here it is a sovereign work of God which brings new life to  the Church.</p>
