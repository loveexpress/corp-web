  <h4 id="articleTitle"> A Wall Of Remembrance</h4>
  <div id="authorname">
    <p>By Edith M. Stranges, Editor/Publisher</p>
    </div>
  <p >My earliest memories of attending a prayer meeting was at my church, the Van Nest Assembly of God in the Bronx, NY. I don't remember the exact night but, the Lord brought back to my memory the night I was praying at the altar. I was either 6 or 8 years old. I was sobbing and wailing so much so, that the tissues that were given to me were not sufficient. I remember praying and asking God for the souls of people, people who I didn't know in other countries. I was just weeping and crying. You've got to understand, I was not superspiritual or even spirit filled, but I knew at that moment in my life something was different.</p>
  <p>It wasn't until 25 years later when I received the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and I was slain in the spirit for at least an hour. It was during that time that the Holy Spirit played in my mind like a movie scene the events of my life up until that point and gave me a glimpse of the future. He began to show me as a young girl praying at the altar and at the same time unbeknownst to me God was moving in David my future husband life. As a teenager he received many prophetic prophecies pertaining to his future and his calling. Our lives went different ways but in God's master plan he adjusted our lives so we met when I was 14. We were just friends. David was 20 and we would meet every month at a Christian gathering with other friends, then it happened. To make a long story short, we got engaged and I married at 19. The calling was deep inside of me, the calling of a intercessory prayer warrior, and the ministry of reconciliation. Now over 60 years later, God said to build Him a WALL OF REMEMBRANCE, a fortress of prayer around your loved ones, your friends and yourself.</p>
  <p>Many things have happened in the last 2 1/2 years. Changes in my appearance, I've lost over 90 lbs. through Jesus Christ. Changes in my spiritual walk and in my prayer walk.</p>
  <p>Now God said, &quot;This is the time to gather the prayer warriors and war against the enemy that is holding back your loved ones and your blessings.&quot; I've made a commitment to pray everyday in the prayer closet (WAR ROOM) over the photos that you will send in, the nation, the world, pastors, members of churches and <strong>The Love Express</strong>.</p>
  <p>I need you to pray with me. Together we will see a great manifestation of God's glory and power in this region.</p>
  <p>Remember to send in your prayer request and photos and when you do, put the name and address on the back.</p>
  <p>Join us in the War Room as Watchmen on the Walls of New York City. Sunday 1:15pm-Fridays 6:00pm at The Word Center.</p>
  <p>The War Room is open for prayer everyday between 12pm-4pm @ 300 West 38th Street, 2nd Floor (between 8th &amp; 9th Aves.) New York, NY.</p>
  <p><strong>PS: &quot;The Clock Is TIcking.&quot;</strong> I'm asking the faithful readers of <strong>The Love Express</strong> for your assistance. If you know of anyone that has been in <strong>The Love Express</strong>, would you prayerfully pray that God would supply their needs. Continue to support your church. The Church needs finances.</p>
  <p><strong>P.S. The Love Express</strong> should not be used as a tool for information for their own agenda. The Lord states, &ldquo;Do not build on another man&rsquo;s foundation.&rdquo; The goal of <strong>The Love Express</strong> is not to be a paper of competition, strife or jealousy, although sometimes it appears that way. My heart is for the reconciliation of the Body of Christ.</p>
