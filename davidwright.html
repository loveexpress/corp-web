              <p>By Pastor Elder David Wright<br />
              Grace Tabernacle Church</p>
            </div>
      <p >        The world remembers that fateful day July 4th, 2008&mdash;the day my father, the late great Timothy Wright, my mother Betty, and my nephew, D.J. were struck by a car on a road in Danville, PA. This tragic accident, that killed both my mother and nephew, left my father paralyzed and lingering in life&mdash;only to succumb to death a year later. My family and I will never forget that day. That day, my world as I knew it changed forever...</p>
      <p>People ask me &ldquo;How are you coping?&rdquo; </p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been asked that question so much, by so many who are trying to figure out how to get through similar situations and I want be honest&mdash;it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> easy&mdash;but this is what I&rsquo;ve learned:</p>
      <p>First, I take solace in knowing that my parents and nephew are at peace in Heaven. This life teaches us many hard lessons, but I can truly say that &ldquo;God is Good <em>all</em> the time!&rdquo; because I know their souls are resting in the grace of God. </p>
      <p>Second, I have had some time to collect my thoughts&mdash;my feelings about how my parents&rsquo; and nephew&rsquo;s deaths have affected my family and myself. It has been over a year since Dad&rsquo;s homegoing. It has been over two since Mom&rsquo;s and D.J.&rsquo;s homegoing. They say weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning light. And the shadows of my mourning are receding in the joy of living in both my Fathers&rsquo; wills. </p>
      <p>I believe in my heavenly Father, who sustains me and provides for all of my needs. I have faith that God is in control of it all. Without faith in God, it is impossible to get through a tragedy such as we have experienced. With the God&rsquo;s help, I had to realize that this world was never their home. It is not mine nor is it yours. As Christians we understand that our final destination is Heaven. I pray that I&rsquo;m living up to <em>His</em> standards. As long as I please Jesus, I know my parents are well pleased. And the thought that I <em>will</em> see them again gives me hope to go on.</p>
      <p>And I remember my earthly father was such a man of God; he believed in forgiveness and he believed in second chances. While Dad was alive he forgave the driver who struck them. As difficult as it was, the entire Wright family joined him in forgiveness. Dad understood that holding onto that kind of pain could lead only to the stain of hatred, an unforgiveable sin more destructive to the person who hates than anyone else. Dad released us of the burden even as he struggled with the consequence. An amazing lesson. </p>
      <p>Also, my Dad always saw things in me that I didn&rsquo;t see in myself. And I know he&rsquo;s glad that I&rsquo;m walking in my purpose. I can&rsquo;t fill his shoes but I can follow his steps. He was a great man. Not just a preacher, singer, songwriter, and pastor. But a great man. His example keeps teaching me every day. </p>
      <p>And I can&rsquo;t leave Mom out, because she gave me the most important tool for life. My Mom&rsquo;s <em>prayers</em> are what I hold on to when I don&rsquo;t know what else to do. She prayed that I would be doing exactly what I&rsquo;m doing now&mdash;preaching the gospel and living a Christ-filled life. My Mom&rsquo;s Friday night prayers still have a great effect on all of us Wrights. That keeps my faith strong.</p>
      <p>The lessons they taught me&mdash;the memories that they left here&mdash;that&rsquo;s what keeps me going. </p>
      <p>Their legacy will live on &lsquo;cuz I&rsquo;m not <em>gonna</em> let it die. As the newly installed pastor of Grace Tabernacle Christian Center, I can tell you that people are being saved, delivered and filled with the Holy Ghost. Grace Tabernacle is doing well and the Lord is blessing us every day. I&rsquo;m continuing where my parents left off. And that&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m getting over!</p>
      <p>For those of you suffering the death or loss of a loved one, I pray that you find peace and comfort in the Lord. I want to give you just a few tools that my family and I have used to get through the worst of the storm: </p>
      <p>1. <strong>Pray</strong> &mdash; God needs to know what you need, talk to Him.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Trust in God</strong> &mdash; Even when it&rsquo;s hard and you can&rsquo;t see the light.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Forgive</strong> &mdash; Yourself and others because hatred will eat you alive.</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Remember</strong> &mdash; Embrace those positive memories of those who are gone.</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Let Go!</strong>  &mdash; Remember that God is in control, so you don&rsquo;t need to be.</p>
      <p>6. <strong>Look to Heaven</strong> &mdash; Live a Christ-Filled life and remember Heaven is our final destination.</p>
      <p>I pray you find consolation in this message and I invite you to commune with us as we continue to celebrate the lives of two of Christ&rsquo;s most devoted soldiers!</p>
