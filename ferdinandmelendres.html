            Filipino Community in NYC</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Rev. Ferdinand V. Melendres</p>
            </div>
      <p >Farewell 2007 and welcome 2008, the old has gone and the new has come! The end of the year does not mean the end of life, but only to give way for another new year; the beginning of a new born days again in our lives. The start that has not ended yet is a start again to be ended, be it successful or what, God only knows.</p>
      <p>Many economists in the world had predicted that the Philippines will be one of the most dangerous economic performers this year. Despite of the current strength of peso value against foreign currencies, they consider lots of factors for this prediction. The Glorietta blast, the Batasan bombing, the 500 thousand cash gift among the governors and other government officials, the lavish travel spending of the office of the president, the Trillanes-Manila Pen incident, and the worse corruption within the government are some of many reasons why the Philippine economy will flunk once again this year. Those images had left the mark of doubts and anxiety even within the Filipinos themselves.</p>
      <p>The Philippians and the Filipinos in the recent years had gained a relatively poor image of themselves in international scene. As I have traveled in many countries like Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Thailand, Middle East, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, England, France, Belgium, Spain, Israel and others, it is noticeable that Asian products are scattered from city to city, displaying their new technology and inventions on their fabulous way, but rare to see products bearing the seal &ldquo;Made in the Philippines.&rdquo; The fact is the Philippines find herself lagging behind her most Asian counterparts in modern time.</p>
      <p>However, ancient literatures written within and outside the land show the good characters and image of ancient Filipinos. They live in affluence because God had endowed them with good land and natural resources. The former president Manuel L. Quezon once said that God has been so generous with the Filipinos for giving the people one of the most beautiful, one of the richest countries upon the face of the earth. Immediately after the Second World War, it was said that the Philippines has the best schools and colleges, and the most progressive business environment in region, being highly admired by the many Asian and Western people.</p>
      <p>During the Spanish regime, in the beginning of the 17th century, the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade that lasted for 250 years (1571-1821) guaranteed and established the economic life and prosperity of the Filipino people. This galleon trade gave an enormous boost not only to the growth of commercial condition and lives of the people, but also the immigration of foreigners from different parts of the region, particularly the Chinese community. It became evident that Manila could serve as a collection point from which many of the precious goods and produce from Asian region could find their market to the Americas and Europe. As one Jesuit historian said, &ldquo;traders, merchants, missionaries, artists and travelers from Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and America flocked to this land.&rdquo; Spanish and rich Filipinos were importing foreign workers and slaves to do domestic and hard works in the fields and construction of churches and bridges. One traveler even said in his journal saying, &ldquo;so equally situated between the wealthy kingdom of the east and of the west, that it may be accounted one of the greatest places of trade in the world.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Aside from commercial industries, hospitals and orphanages flourished in the land too due to the untiring works of God-fearing and honest Catholic Christian missionaries and local converts. Not only had the native poor and unfortunate people been benefited from this noble and honorable works but also the foreign neighboring countries. The charities of certain organizations were extended to the strangers from India, Siam, China, and Japan, and Malay Peninsula. The nation was not only the thriving center for commerce and trade, but also the only Christian nation in Asia ready to help and extend her arms and be the witness of Christ Jesus in the surrounding neighbors in time of need.</p>
      <p>In our generation, the Filipino politicians and economists had done many great things to improve the economy and to liberate the country from poverty that plagued the people for so many years. Sad to say, after many years of research and experiment, and changing one government to another to find brilliant solutions, nothing had been achieved. The country remains underprivileged, and poverty is still the public enemy number one. Politicians blamed each other of corruptions but no one is willing to admit of his corrupt works. As a result, the citizens move out to find green pastures to work and serve other foreign nations, a very opposite of our forefathers&rsquo; experience.</p>
      <p>In the Bible, the Lord God had warned His people that if they will not heed the voice of the Lord, &ldquo;The alien who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you, and you shall come down lower and lower. He (alien) shall lend to you, but you shall not lend to him (alien); he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail&rdquo; (Duet. 28:43, 44). Though this passage was directly addressed to the Israelites, this biblical principle can also be applied to everyone who believed in the God of Israel like the Christian Filipinos. There is no better way for our countries economy and people than to put our trust in the Lord. We need to go back to our humble beginning where the people lived in prosperity and abundance because of their obedience to the biblical principle where honesty, mercy, and humility reign supreme. Our country needs no new leadership, but new hearts within the government leaders, that could only be achieved through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Listen to what the ancient Israelite prophet said, &ldquo;You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth&rdquo; (Duet. 8:18). God gives wisdom to the simple, and imparts ability to those who are willing to obey His words.</p>
      <p>As we welcome the New Year today, let us search our hearts and ask ourselves what good things that seems right in God&rsquo;s eye that we need to do for our country and our people. We may not be as great as some of our politicians and economists, but we can do simple things that will make the heart of God glad.</p>
