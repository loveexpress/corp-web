            <h4 class="qa">Melvin C. Walker &ldquo;The Gospel Ambassador&rdquo;</h4>
            <div id="authorname"></div>
              <p >People can say what they want about gospel music industry and some of the people in it that make it challenging but there are still a lot of good people who truly demonstrate Jesus... The Gospel Ambassador was one. He was truly a man that demonstrated God&rsquo;s love, compassion, and was a true anchor in keeping God's music alive in NYC as far back as the 70&rsquo;s. This is why many miss him after his passing on June 28, 2007 after a short illness. He was 70.</p>
              <p>Long before I met Rev.  Melvin C. Walker, aka &ldquo;The Gospel Ambassador,&rdquo; in my days at WWRL, when it was gospel, I had heard about him. Many knew him from his &ldquo;Gospel Time&rdquo; radio show on WTHE 1520 AM, doing gospel when it was not popular to be a gospel announcer. For many years he served as founder and pastor of the Gospel Blessing Center Church in Roosevelt, L.I. Others knew him because through his Willing Workers for Christ Inc. and People Helping People programs that organized relief efforts for hurricane victims of Hugo in Hamlin, South Carolina, Andrew in Miami Fla., and in Hamlet North Carolina due to the Imperial Chicken Plant fire. Yet most of us knew him for breaking some of Gospel Music&rsquo;s best at his concerts and Joy Nights musical events</p>
              <p>Walker in 1962 met the &ldquo;Dean of Gospel,&rdquo; the late Joe Bostic, Sr. of WLIB Radio. Joe Bostic was the first to dub, Rev. Walker, &ldquo;The Gospel Ambassdor.&rdquo; This distinction was given to him because of his humanitarian efforts both locally and nationally to help those less fortunate.</p>
              <p>Shortly thereafter, he became the A&amp;R Director at Hob-Scepter Records. There he worked alongside producer John Bowden and owner Mancell Warwick (Dionne Warwick&rsquo;s father). During his time at Hob-Scepter Records he promoted to the top of the charts Rev. James Cleveland&rsquo;s, &ldquo;The Love of God,&rdquo; Shirley Caesar&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Be Afraid&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Go,&rdquo; and Institutional Church of God In Christ Radio Choir&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stretch Out.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Many came out to a Homegoing &ldquo;Joy Night&rdquo; tribute on Friday, July 6, 2007 at the Zion Cathedral Church of God in Christ in Freeport, Long Island. The night was well attended as Rev. David Gates and Bishop Sam Williams navigated us through a night of Joy, Laughter, memoirs of Rev. Walker, and great singing. Many fellow radio announcers like myself and Bro. Bill from WHCR 90.3 in Harlem and Sis. Minister from WTHE 1520AM were in attendance. The house was full of fellow clergy dignitaries but some that spoke were of course the overseers of Zion Cathedral Bishop Frank O. White and Pastor Anthone White, Rev. Al Sharpton, Bishop Woodside, Bishop AD Lyons, James Garner the former Mayor of Hempstead, Larry Clarke Esquire, and Dr. Ronald Carter. Blessing us with musical tributes were Mark Reddick, Rev. Timothy Wright, 1st Lady Matty Newman, Sis. Kitra Williams and a wonderful mass choir filled with singers and musicians such as, Butch Haywood, Professor James Hall, Dr. Kevin Bond, Rev. David Gates, and a host of singers to numerous to name. What a way to send us home and to bless the family at this time.</p>
              <p>Rev. Dr. Melvin C. Walker is survived by his wife of 49 years, Shirley; five sons, Robert of Mastic Park, David of Wheatley Heights, Steven of Philadelphia, Mel&shy;vin Jr. of Hempstead and John of Townsend, Md; two daughters, Yvonne Curtis of Philadelphia and Shirmel Wiggs of Randallstown, Md; one adopted son, Lawrence, NYC; and 10 grandchildren.</p>
              <p>Rev. Walker was noted for saying, <em>&ldquo;If I can help somebody...My living shall not be in vain.&rdquo;</em></p>
