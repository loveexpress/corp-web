              <p >Wow! Has it actually been 30  years since we started this awesome ministry tool? As difficult as it is to  believe that much time has passed, I've shared before how The Love Express has  impacted my personal life. I met the young lady who would one day become my  wife of 25 years, (this September 1) and the mother of my three babies Michael  II, Rachael &amp; Mit&shy;chel, currently ages 23, 21 &amp; 12 respectively.</p>
              <p>I  still have memories be&shy;ing in a station wagon, driving around to various  churches, ministries and businesses trying to communicate the vision of unity  in the paper and getting people to understand importance of being a part of  that. Not to be negative, but we were met with a few doubters and some folk who  just didn't get us. There were people who questioned our untested motives or  who cautiously watched to see where we were going with this little newspaper.  And yes, there were those who tried to &quot;compete&quot; or actually wanted  to see us fail because they thought this venture was about making a bunch of  money.</p>
              <p>Well  here we are 30 years later and I believe we have responded to every naysayer  that we've faced by simple staying the course assigned by our loving Heavenly  Father. When you do what God has given you to do, you're not responsible for  the outcome. In this case the outcome however has pro&shy;ven to be worth every  challenge. Ministry leaders who would never have even heard of each other or  even those who were suspicious of each other, have now come toge&shy;ther to  realize how much they have in common while celebrating the rich diversity that  comprises this remarkable body of Christ (Psalm 133:1 - Behold how good and how  pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity).</p>
              <p>I  pay homage to Cliff and Elaine Dubrowsky who sought us out to help carry this  vision to New York City. We went to Connecticut eve&shy;ry month and spent all day  and night literally cutting and&nbsp; pasting  each component of our periodical. We had no idea what we were doing - looking  for inspiring articles and stories, searching for clip art and attempting to  resize them to fit those articles. Before that, we had to solicit advertisers  to finance this effort. This became our job, our careers, our ministry and we  had to figure this out with no experience to speak of. God used Cliff and  Elaine to teach us everything we needed to know to get this thing off and  running.</p>
              <p>After  a couple of years they move out west and we were left in the capable hands of  Robert Morgan in New Paltz, NY. At that time there were editions of the Love  Express in various ci&shy;ties across the country. Soon we would outgrow all of the  other publications and had to illicit the help of a local typesetter. Thanks  for your tireless efforts Ray, in the Bronx. With the advent of desk top  publishing we had to delve in even more uncharted territo&shy;ry. I was terrified  and felt ill equipped to tackle such a task. I was never a techie and had  barely learned how to make entries into a CRT working at SAKS Fifth Avenue.  (Remember those ancient two color computers?). But I was staying up to 3 or 4  in the morning while my new wife was home pregnant with our first born. By the  time he was born, after 1 day of QuarkXpress lessons and many late nights, some  of this was starting to make sense and I was getting a little more proficient  at mani&shy;pulating the &quot;mouse.&quot;</p>
              <p>More  churches and Christian businesses were starting to buy into the concept and we  no longer had to beat the pavement to find advertisers. We still made lots of  phone calls to invite new business but in the booming technological age learned  how to work smarter rather than harder. My wife Rhonda with my son stretched  out on a table, came on board to help us crank out those articles. No need to  call Child Services, he was well taken care of. Anyway the design ideas started  to flow, and we all began to specialize, each having his/her own set of  responsibilities in getting this paper printed and distributed to those  anxiously awaiting its publication.</p>
              <p>For  30 years, every month without fail, it has come out. For quite a few years,  beautiful color ads have graced the pages. It has been as small as 8 pages and  as many as 108 pages. More and more advertisements come camera ready and others  are still produced in <b>The Love</b> <b>Express</b> office. Seve&shy;ral staff  member past and present have sat in front of the computer including, Amie,  Sidney. Sehon, Sha&shy;nelle, Melville, Gregory, Tam&shy;my, Natalie to name a few. I  can't forget us sponsoring New York City's first &rdquo;March for Jesus.&quot; What  an impact that made on the Christian and secular community.</p>
              <p>It  would be impossible to really recap all these years in one article. Many great  men and women of God have gone on to be with The Lord, in 30 years while  existing families are expanding and new ministries are birthed throughout this  fair city. The circle of life continues. I'm just glad to have been a part of <b>The</b> <b>Love Express</b> legacy. Edie, William, Naomi &amp; distributors, thank you  for 30 years of service to the&nbsp; Body of  Christ. Deb and others thanks for stepping in.</p>
