      <p ><strong>A Stress Free Morning Routine for Back To School</strong></p>
      <p>Let's go! Let's go! Come on &hellip;you're going to miss the bus! I don't know where your favorite jeans are; it's not my responsibility. What do you mean you still have homework? Did you brush your teeth yet? Let's go! I'm leaving&hellip; NOW!</p>
      <p>Oh I hope your mornings don't sound like that above. If it does, it's not too late to turn that ship around. The key to having a stress free morning routine is to have a smooth bedtime routine. Remember, a routine is something that is followed regularly, standard procedures. Without the consistency you will have an uphill battle.</p>
      <p>Here are some tips to a stress free morning routine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>  No yelling. Raising your voice, albeit frustrated, is only going to escalate matters.<br />
        </li>
        <li> Early to bed, early to rise. That one is simple.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Showers and baths should be taken at night. You think you'll have time in the morning, but you rarely do.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Look over all homework for completeness before bed; don't assume it's finished.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Before bed ensure lunches are made, backpack is packed and there are no surprise &quot;Oh I need xxx today!&quot;<br />
        </li>
        <li>Give singular instructions. Don't say, &quot;I want you to finish your homework, eat breakfast, get dressed, comb your hair, brush your teeth and be in the car by 8:15.&quot; To a child, that sounds like &quot;blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.&quot; One instruction at a time works wonders.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Provide instructions once. If you're doing this, stop: &quot;Johnny, it's time to get dressed.&quot; Two minutes later, &quot;Johnny, we're going to be late if you don't get dressed now.&quot; Two more minutes later, &quot;Johnny, honey, I told you to get dressed.&quot; &quot;Johnny, Mommy is going to be late, now go get dressed.&quot; To a child that sounds like &quot;Oh mom is good for asking about five more times before she really goes ballistic!&quot; Repeated requests only send the message that junior doesn't really have to do it now.<br />
        </li>
        <li>Set consequences and stick to your guns. If you tell your child the car is leaving at 8:15 sharp, make it happen. Clearly you can't leave your child behind, so leaving without her isn't an option. Tell her you will be leaving whether she is ready or not. Sending a 10 year old to school with uncombed hair, pajamas and an empty belly might be just the catalyst for change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You are the parent; you set the tone for the morning routine. You need to be actively involved in the morning routine. Follow the steps above and I guarantee 'joy will come in the morning!' </p>

      <p><strong>Tips for making homework less work for both kids &amp; parents</strong></p>
      <p>Some parents are shocked when their first-grader comes home from school with homework. The reality is children are learning more at a younger age and take-home assignments are increasing. Parents play an important role in engaging children and providing a positive homework environment, but knowing what is best for kids can be as confusing as the assignments themselves.</p>
      <p>How much homework should the average student have? The National PTA recommends 10 to 20 minutes per night in the first grade, and an additional 10 minutes per grade level thereafter. For example: 20 minutes for second grade, 120 minutes for 12th grade. Some older students may have more de&shy;pending on their class load.</p>
      <p>Balancing school, homework, extracurricular activities and family life is important for good childhood development. This year as part of its back to school campaign, Lance Sandwich Crackers has partnered with Colleen Burns, The Mom on the Run parenting expert and mother of five boys, to provide practical advice for parents to help them make homework a positive experience for everyone.</p>
      <p><strong>Give them time to unwind.</strong> Unwinding is an important preparation step. Your kids have been sitting and learning all day - minus the walk, car or bus ride home. Give them 15 to 20 minutes to blow off some steam and run around outside before they start their homework. Everyone needs a little break. </p>
      <p><strong>Positive reinforcement.</strong> A positive attitude goes a long way. Shower children with positive reinforcement. For larger homework projects completed over several days, reward each step as well as the overall completion. It's important for kids to understand that progress is being made.</p>
      <p><strong>Keep snacks on hand.</strong> Remember hungry kids are distracted kids, so offer them a wholesome snack while they work. Lance Sandwich Crackers, which are available in 19 varieties, including whole grain, 100-calorie and reduced-fat options have zero grams of trans fat, no preservatives and no high fructose corn syrup, making them a sensible snack any time of day.</p>
      <p><strong>Get help when needed.</strong> Feeling stumped with your child's homework question? You're not the first parent to feel that way. When your child asks a question you don't know how to answer, show them that mom and dad sometimes need help too. These are some great resources to help parents help kids:<br />
        </p>
      <p>* www.dadmath.com<br />
        *www.scholastic.com/kids/homework <br />
        *www.niehs.nih.gov/health/scied/students/homework <br />
        *www.thinkfinity.org/parents -and-kids </p>
      <p><strong>Set the stage for success.</strong> Set aside a space or corner that is the designated space for completing homework. All family members should recognize that when someone is sitting in that area, they should not be disturbed unless they ask for help. Don't underestimate the importance of a comfortable chair and proper lighting when it comes to making homework time a pleasant experience. Set household homework rules. Mom, dad and other siblings should not be watching TV in or near someone completing homework. All house or cell phones should be &quot;parked&quot; - this goes for mom and dad also.</p>
      <p><strong>Create a homework kit for each child.</strong> Prepare a &quot;homework kit&quot; with all the necessary supplies your children will need to complete their assignments. Contents vary by age, but usually include pencils, pens, highlighters, ruler, crayons, markers, glue sticks, erasers and a pencil sharpener. Older children might need a calculator or other electronic items. As part of its back to school campaign, Lance is offering the chance to win a $500 gift card or one of 25 homework caddies, complete with materials your child needs to get their homework done. Be sure to visit <a href="http://www.Facebook.com/LanceSnacks">www.Facebook.com/LanceSnacks</a> to enter.</p>
      <p>And always remember, homework is about practice - it will take some children longer than others to get the hang of it. With the right preparations and materials on hand, you can ensure that homework time in your household is effective and enjoyable for the whole family.<br />

      <p><strong>Christian Back to School Tips<br />
      </strong><strong><br />
        Get Enough Sleep.<br />
      </strong>As parents we all know the benefits of getting our children to bed early on a school night. Resting in the Lord will also make you fit and ready for the day. It will recharge you.<br />
      <span class="articlecredits">&quot;Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him...&quot;Psalm 37:7</span></p>
      <p><strong>Get a Healthy Breakfast.</strong> <br />
        The experts all agree that giving a child breakfast before school helps in knowledge retention, test scores, and overall learning. As Christians we need to get a healthy breakfast of Bible study and prayer.</p>
      <p><strong>Follow The Rules.</strong><br />
        School couldn't be productive if it weren't for the rules. We can all remember some of the basics. No fighting. No talking during class. No chewing gum. As Christians we have the best rule book of all. It covers all of the basics. We need to use it as a guide on a daily basis. All of those do's and don't in God's Word are there to help us live productive lives.</p>
      <p><strong>Develop Good Work and Study Habits.</strong><br />
        Children that develop good study habits are the ones who sail through school without major problems. We as Christians need to develop good study habits when it comes to God's Word. Knowing the Word is what is going to make or break us.<br />
        <span class="articlecredits">&quot;Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&quot; 2 Timothy 2:15</span></p>
      <p><strong>Try Your Best.</strong><br />
        Teaching our children to do their best will bring results and they can be proud of themselves. It's rewarding to do your best.</p>
      <p><strong>Get Along With Your Classmates.</strong><br />
        When children are taught to get along together at school it causes such a good atmosphere for learning. When we as Christians get along with each other and fellowship with one another, it causes more productive lives, which helps further the cause of Christ.</p>
      <p><strong>Get To Know
        Your Teacher.</strong><br />
        One of the first things a student needs to learn is what is expected of him from his teacher. How does that teacher deal with homework? With classroom policies? With grades? We need to know what Christ expects of us. Getting to know God will help us serve Him better.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:<br />
        So, are you ready for the school of life?</strong></p>
      <p class="articlecredits">Reprinted with permission from Julia Betten&shy;court Copyright&copy;2001-2010</p>
      <p><strong>Back To School Prayers God,</strong> I'm going to be real honest. I don't want to go back to school. But I really do want to start the year right. So help me to change my not-so-great attitude.</p>
      <p><strong>Father,</strong> I want you to be right beside me at school this year, almost like you're my best friend. If you were really walking beside me, maybe I'd be more concerned about pleasing you than pleasing others. If you were there beside me, maybe I'd realize I could talk to you anytime I wanted, and lean on you when I'm feeling sad or dumb. Help me know you really will be right beside me each day of this school year.</p>
      <p><strong>Dear Lord,</strong> It would be so easy to look around school and see all the losers. Not a cool way of thinking, is it? Help me with this, OK? Instead of looking at others as losers, help me to see them as people you love, people made in your image, people you died for.</p>
      <p><strong>Father in Heaven,</strong> When I'm around my friends at church, it's so easy to act like a Christian. Then I get back with my school friends and I'm like this completely different person. I want to keep my faith real this year. So please do whatever it takes to help me be the same person at school as I am at church. In spite of my flaws and the mistakes I make, help me to be totally committed to you.</p>
      <p><strong>Lord,</strong> At school, I see athletes and cheerleaders who seem to have it all together. I see the latest fashions on the coolest kids. I see cars in the parking lot that make me jealous. But then I think about a world I don't really see&mdash;an invisible world. It's the world where a lonely freshman is important. It's a world where a genuine smile means so much more than an expensive car. It's a world where the kid in the wheelchair is strong and powerful. It's a world that values honesty and love more than cool and popular stuff. It's a world where I'd discover that even the cool kids struggle and feel insecure sometimes. Help me catch a small glimpse of this invisible world this year. If I do, I just might value what you value, love what you love and want what you want.</p>
