              <p >Many  parents assume that a few scuffles with other kids are par for the course  during childhood, and that dealing with a bully or two builds character,  especially if a son or daughter learns to stand up to the offender (with or  without a punch or two being thrown in the  process). These themes have driven crowd-pleasing movies such as <i>The </i><i>Karate Kid</i> and <i>Back to the Future</i>, but what happens off the silver screen is  another story.</p>
              <p>In  everyday life, bullying is abusive, ugly and disturb&shy;ingly common, with profound  and sometimes lethal consequences. Indeed, its physical and emotional impact on children is now being addressed as a  serious health issue by professional organizations such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American  Medical Association, as well as by governmental agencies. </p>
              <p><b>What Is Bullying, and How </b><b>Bad Is This Problem?</b></p>
              <p>To be  specific, bullying involves ongoing aggressive behavior intended to cause harm or distress in a relationship where  there is an imbalance of power, physical or otherwise. Bullying is literally  &quot;as old as sin&quot; and can occur at any stage of life, but it is  particularly common &mdash; and destructive &mdash; during childhood and adolescence. </p>
              <p>Sadly but  not surprising&shy;ly, the targets of bullying are often those who are poorly  equipped to deal with it: the small, the weak, those who look or act a little  different from the crowd, and those who have difficulty making and keeping  friends. Bullying goes well beyond the usual horseplay, verbal and otherwise,  of childhood and adolescence. It is  essentially child abuse perpetrated by peers, and it may take a variety  of forms:</p>
              <p><b>&bull; </b><i>Verbal.</i> Insults, name-calling, racial or ethnic  slurs. These are experienced equally by boys and girls, and represent the most  common form of bullying. </p>
              <p><b><i>&bull; </i></b><i>Physical.</i> Hitting,  kicking, shoving or other direct bodily injury, as well as destruction </p>
              <p><b><i>&bull; </i></b><i>Social.</i> Spreading gossip and rumors  (often sexually related), exclusion or  outright isolation. These are more common forms of bullying among girls. <br>
                <b><i>&bull; </i></b><i>Electronic </i><b><u>&quot;Cyberbullying&quot;</u></b> on the  Internet or through other electronic devices  such as text messaging on cell phones.</p>
              <p>Statistics  about bullying are based primarily on survey data, which have typically found  that at any given time between 20 and 30 percent  of students are involved, either as perpetrators, victims or both. For  example, one national survey of more than fifteen thousand adolescents in the  sixth through tenth grade found that 11 percent reported being bullied, 13  percent admitted to bullying others, and another 6 percent said they both  bullied others and had been the targets of bullying themselves. Bullying is ubiquitous: It is not restricted to any  particular geographic location, community setting (urban, suburban or rural),  ethnic group or socioeconomic status. It is more common at school &mdash; in the  classroom, hallway, playground or lunchroom  &mdash; than on the way to or from school.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately,  statistics only dimly reflect the pain endured by victims of bullying. Aside  from any physical injuries they might sustain, they are also more likely to  suffer from anxiety, depression and physical complaints such as headaches,  abdominal pain and fatigue. </p>
              <p>Needless  to say, reluctance to go to school (or wherever the bullying is taking place)  is a common manifestation and may result in numerous missed days of school. <i>When a child or adolescent is experiencing  frequent school absences, especially  due to physical complaints for which a medical evaluation reveals no specific  cause, victimization by bullying should be considered as a possible &mdash; or likely &mdash; cause.</i> Unfortunately, all too  often a child or teen will be reluctant to report what has happened to parents  or school officials &mdash; even if asked directly &mdash; because of a conviction that  nothing can be done about it, lack of confidence that teachers or administrators will take effective action and (most  importantly) fear of retaliation.</p>
              <p>Even more  worrisome is the connection between bullying and violence, by both the  perpetrator and victim. Children and teens who bully are more likely to be involved or injured in fights, and to steal,  vandalize, smoke, use alcohol, drop out of school and carry a weapon. Furthermore, those who have been repeatedly  victimized may decide to seek spectacular and tragic revenge. In 2002, the United States Secret Ser&shy;vice and the  United States Department of Education evaluated thirty-seven mass school  shootings that had occurred between 1974 and 2000.  Of the forty-one attackers involved, three out of four had felt  persecuted and bullied prior to the incident.</p>
              <p>What can be done about bullying? Preventing,  detecting and responding to bullying require involvement of parents, schools,  churches and (when necessary) law enforcement.</p>
