              <p>The  privilege of working with hundreds of chur&shy;ches  and their men has aided Men&rsquo;s Discipleship Network gather empirical da&shy;ta  over the past 18 years of mi&shy;nistry to men. It  has led me to conclude that when looking for Biblical success in men, it  is vital that we not only seek the right answers, but also that we ask the  right questions.</p>
              <p><em><u>The wrong question:</u></em> What  will make men grow in the Church today?</p>
              <p><em><u>The right question:</u></em> What is  keeping men from growing in the Church today?</p>
              <p><em> I  believe there are ten major reasons why men do not grow in Christ. Space only  allows us to discuss five of those reasons in this article.</em></p>
              <p><strong><u>Reason# 1: <em>They  are given a &quot;code of ethics&quot; instead of the Creed of Christ.</em></u></strong></p>
              <p> The common way to deal with lukewarmness  among men today is to make them feel guilty and condemned. So guilt is the tool  that&rsquo;s used as the driver to get them to &ldquo;behave&rdquo; like men. An unspoken voice  whispers <strong><em>&ldquo;I am a Holy God, the man teaching you is kind of Holy, you are not,  try har&shy;der.&rdquo;</em></strong> Many times a man appears like he is growing for 6-18  months until he exhausts the arm of his flesh through spirit-less effort. He  enters into the Romans 7 maze that bemoans &ldquo;I  should be a better husband and father, be a more responsible and  accountable guy, who is less angry and  frustrated, <strong><em>but </em></strong><strong><em>I can&rsquo;t!&quot;</em></strong> This man is stuck and  scared, and will not mature. Effectively teaching men must include  an attempt to show a man the Father&rsquo;s unconditional love and security found in  his adoption as a son upon his conversion (Rom  8:15). Jesus Christ mo&shy;deled &ldquo;sonship&rdquo; in a powerful way. This brings us  to number 2.</p>
              <p><strong><u>Reason# 2:<em> A Veiled Perspective of Jesus Christ As A Man.</em></u></strong> Men are  so glued to our Lord&rsquo;s deity, that Jesus&rsquo; indomitable humanity is lost on them.  The ability to pull attributes from His most outstanding life is vital for us  as we seek to model our lives after Him. Our most authentic model for manhood  is Christ. When a man pulls parallels from the heart of Christ he cannot help but  mature his soul. Problems occur when a man compares himself to other men  without Jesus as the standard.</p>
              <p><strong><u>Reason# 3:<em> Teaching Men Account-ability, Before Accept-ability, Relate-ability &amp;  Sustain-ability in godly relationships.</em></u></strong> The most  overused word in ministry to men today is &ldquo; accountability.&quot; A second word  when used out of context gives counterfeit power to the legalist:&ldquo;admonish.&rdquo;  These two biblical concepts when taught incorrectly  to the immature are a cause for mass exodus in the church. Jesus was a magnet  to men! Men should be drawn to us. There should  be an expected spirit of freedom every time they come, not control and  condemnation that makes them run. The curse for Christian men is isolation. <strong><em>Isolation  is the breeding ground for delusion, for men are as sick as their secrets.</em></strong> I have much to say about this in MDN curriculums.</p>
              <p><strong>Reason# 4:<em> Teaching men that their habits must go, without  teaching them how to exchange them for ha&shy;bits that help.</em></strong> Men  struggle to find the power to expunge bad habits. Men, out of frustration and  guilt, silently scream &quot;I should be further along than this, but I blew it  again!&rdquo; They become disappointed, and then allow distractions to enter; call it  busyness. Then they shrink back from Christ and His Church. A Man&rsquo;s needs a new thought process to overcome this cycle.  Men have to be engaged mentally, and taught not only what NOT to do, but what  they SHOULD do to replace bad habits. This topic has had the most impact on the  churches attending MDN training.</p>
              <p><strong>Reason# 5:</strong> <strong><em>Teaching  Purpose with out Order.</em></strong> When a man (in an attempt to relate to him) is  taught that his family, job, and hobbies are all equally important to his  primary purpose, the Bible becomes irrelevant. Such teaching does not speak to  the competing values in his life: the Wallet, the Woman, and the Wide World of Sports. The Bible only makes sense to the man  whose primary purpose is fixed upon knowing and loving God. Period. Then all  else follows (Mathew 6:33). The call to be an  incredible husband &amp; dad is a good and grand purpose for life.  Unfortunately, when a man takes a good thing and makes it a god thing, it  becomes a bad thing. </p>
              <p>There is  much more to be said about these 5 points, and indeed we do at Men&rsquo;s Discipleship  Network. Visit our website if you would like to learn more.  (www.mensdiscipleshipnetwork.com).</p>

He speaks at local  churches, Men&rsquo;s Discipleship Boot Camp&reg; as well as the new&shy;ly launched  W.E.A.P.O.N.S. &reg; Curriculum. These events train  men to live free, enabling them to be responsible leaders in their homes, churches and communities.
