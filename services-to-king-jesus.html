              <p>Sacrificial service is motivated by Christ&rsquo;s sa&shy;crifice  on the cross, rather than out of a desire to earn favor with God. Our  motivation for serving others is a response to the grace shown us by Jesus, not  an attempt to earn God&rsquo;s favor through moral behavior. Through service, we  witness a mutual transformation: both the  server and the served grow in the process.</p>
              <p>All over the city, pastors are beginning  to come together in neighborhood-focused groups to talk about their plans of  working toge&shy;ther to serve their communities.</p>
              <p>&bull; In Brooklyn, a group of primarily Chinese  pastors met to discuss the possibilities of afterschool programs badly needed  for the many single-parent, working families in their area. </p>
              <p>&bull; In the Bronx,  another group of pastors and leaders are beginning the process of  planning an evangelistic outreach event that would include a massive  distribution of food and clothing.</p>
              <p>&bull; In Long Island, a group of 20 churches are  working on an 8-week sermon series together with a real push for evangelism.  The purpose of the series is for people to invite their unsaved friends to  explore God at churches. </p>
              <p>&bull; In Staten Island, the Engage Network, which  consists of nearly 20 churches, have divided their region by zip code and will  be working together to do community improvement  projects and engaging in school outrea&shy;ches.</p>
              <p>Our goal is to make the largest impact  possible through NY CityServe &amp; CityFest. You are invited to be part of the  conversation in your borough by joining in a strategic pastors gathering. These  gatherings will also provide a forum for discussion around unique opportunities  to share the Gospel in regionally-based outreach events this spring, as part of  NY CityFest with Luis Palau.</p>
              <p>NY&#8200;CityServe is rooted in the  Biblical values of justice, mercy, humility, unity and love, to be practiced through  collaborative projects celebrating the diversity of God&rsquo;s movement in New York City, in order to seek the peace of the  city for the glory of God. NY CityServe is impelled by the Gospel, connected to  churches, focused on neighborhoods, driven by relationships, and committed to  diversity.</p>
              <p>Throughout New York City, NY CityServe  will celebrate and accelerate what churches are already doing to serve  vulnerable populations. Faith communities around the city will be mobilized to  serve foster children, through working with foster care organizations and  encouraging greater involvement from believers in the fos&shy;ter care system.  Additionally, churches will collaborate withcity and community agencies to  serve New York City&rsquo;s homeless population by facilitating free health care and  solutions for those living in poverty. Throughout New York City, believers will  work together to bring hope to those without hope.</p>
              <p>NY CityServe  &amp; City&shy;Fest partner PULSE&#8200;is working with students at City  College of New York to organize the largest Christian outreach event to ever  come to their campus, and they need your help. Student leaders are asking for  churches like yours to be involved in helping lead their peers to Christ. You are invited to join pastors and ministry  leaders from across New York City at the PULSE  City College Pastors Lunch to learn more.</p>
