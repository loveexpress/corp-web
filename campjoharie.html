            <p>Not much is expected from our teenagers in today&rsquo;s world. In fact, the only thing that is expected of them is trouble. We expect rebellion, anger, trouble, problems, and more. That is not the case at <strong><em>Camp Joharie</em></strong>. We see Teens as a vital part of the Lord&rsquo;s church, who are an untapped source of encouragement, energy, excitement, and love. They have the energy and ability to go into all the world and it is our goal to equip them and send them. While we are not without the &ldquo;teen&rdquo; issues of today, we seek to form a healthy environment in which our teens can grow from their struggles.</p>
            <p>The talents of adults who work with our teens are qualified staff members who provide a variety of programs like music, arts and crafts, film editing, rope course, dance, drama, variety of sports and fitness, horseback riding, with wonderful off campus trips. The programs allow opportunities to increase leadership ability and demonstrate their creative sides. There are events that are &ldquo;girls only&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;boys only.&rdquo; Each group needs to have their spiritual growth fostered in different ways and can benefit from having these times with members of the same gender. There are many outdoor activities, including camping, hiking, rafting and more. Make no mistake, in the midst of having fun, we want your sons and daughters to develop a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ and prepare them for works of service. We want to see our teens involved in service projects, mission projects, and efforts where they share the message of Jesus with others. With the stress of city life gone, they can turn their attention inward and begin addressing their spiritual growth. We want to speak the truth in love. We want to help our teens learn the importance of kindness - kindness to each other.</p>
            <p>Involvement remains a high priority. Each person has different talents. Together, we make up the body of Christ where everyone comes together to do his or her part in helping the kingdom of God grow. We look out for each other. We encourage each other, and we strengthen each other.</p>
            <p>Some of life&rsquo;s most endearing memories are made in summer camp. This year, give your children the opportunity to make lifelong memories while investing in their future. Only <strong>CAMP JOHARIE</strong> delivers custom-created programs designed to keep your child&rsquo;s interest at an all-time high.</p>
            <p class="qa">Testimonials</p>
            <p><em>In just two weeks Camp Joharie accomplished what I&rsquo;ve been trying (to accomplish) for 16 years. My son, who was reluctant to go, now says &ldquo;it was the best 14 days of his life.&rdquo;<strong> (Brown, Parent)</strong></em></p>
            <p><em>It took one week in 1993 for me to realize Camp Joharie was where I wanted to spend my summers with my children. That was the start of a eighteen year relationship with the camp. My children are all grown and still desire to serve at Camp Joharie. They all learned to swim, water ski, and to really love and serve God. There is no place like Camp Joharie to teach children about salvation and how to have fun in Christ.<strong> (Renee Freeman, Parent and program Director, general session)</strong>.</em></p>
            <p><em>Camp Joharie has truly changed my life. I went to camp for many years as a camper, and these past few year as a counselor, and all my experiences were amazing. God always met me in every aspect of my life, and seemed to speak to me so much clearer at Camp Joharie. Coming from NYC, there is continuous noise, but at camp, the quiet and beautiful scenery allows me to see God, even in his nature. At Camp Joharie, at age 16, God helped me to fully submit my life over to him. He never fails to meet the campers, counselors, directors and the entire staff in remarkable life changing ways. I thank God for Camp Joharie &amp; recommend every child and teenager to go to this life changing experience. <strong>(Tanisha Browe, 20)</strong>.</em></p>
