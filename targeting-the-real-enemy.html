              <p>A&nbsp;young child once asked me, &ldquo;Pastor Eddie, since God says we are to love our  enemies, does that mean we are supposed to love the devil?&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Good question! Of course we should hate  the devil! But do we really? The condition of our world saddens us, and we are  grieved to see the hurt and misery Sa&shy;tan causes. But does that mean we really <em>hate</em> Satan?</p>
              <p>I realized that I had not allowed myself  to hate anyone or anything. After all, I thought, hatred is sin, isn&rsquo;t it? Like the did pointed out, didn&rsquo;t Jesus say in  Mt. 5:44, &ldquo;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&rdquo;? Didn&rsquo;t Paul  write in Romans 12:20, &ldquo;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink&rdquo;?</p>
              <p>However, just a few ver&shy;ses earlier,  Paul also says, &ldquo;Hate what is evil&rdquo; Romans 12:9).  He goes on to say &ldquo;Ne&shy;ver be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual  fervor&rdquo; (v.11).</p>
              <p>Had Satan and  his works ever enraged me? Worse yet, had Satan stolen some of  my zeal and spiritual fervor? Where was my fierce, zealous, warring heart?  Where was my righteous indignation? Was it easier for me to be angry with a  person who mistreated me than to be incensed by all that Satan was doing that  was counter to God&rsquo;s kingdom?</p>
              <p>It was these kinds of questions that led  me to train in spiritual warfare.The Lord&rsquo;s primary  method in my training was to take me to the Psalms, where He gave me a new  warfare prayer vocabulary so I could deal effectively with my true enemies:  Satan and his demons.</p>
              <p>Mincing no  words, Da&shy;vid asks God to scoff at His enemies, dash them to pie&shy;ces,  strike them on the jaw, and break their teeth (Psalms. 2:49, 9, 3:7). That&rsquo;s  just in the first few Psalms! This vocabulary  is powerful in equipping us to battle against our spiritual  enemies-spiritual beings for whom there is no  redemption (Eph. 6:12).</p>
              <p>On the other hand, this vocabulary is  not to be used to pray against a person. We are to pray for people. Even for  wicked people, we are to pray for God&rsquo;s mercy and not His judgement (James. 2:13).</p>
              <p>Sadly, I&rsquo;ve heard foolish, misguided  Christians pray for homosexuals to become infected with AIDS &ldquo;so they will  learn that they cannot disobey God.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve  heard others reverse curses and even multiply them back up&shy;on someone  they suspect of having cursed them. But Je&shy;sus  said, &ldquo;Bless those who curse you&rdquo; (Luke. 6:28).</p>
              <p>So how does all of this work? Take one  of the Psalms that speaks against enemies and pray it against the powers of  darkness. For example, you could pray from Psalm  35 something like this: &ldquo;Fight against those  spiritual forces that fight against me, Lord. Brandish spear and javelin  against those who pursue; me. Disgrace and put to shame those who seek my life;  may those who plot; my ruin be turned back in dismay; drive them away; pursue  them down a dark and slippery path; entangle them in their own net; may they  fall into the pit they dug for me. May all who gloat over my distress be put to  shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame  and disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Many of the Psalms are easily adapted  for this purpose. Some especially powerful ones include Psalms 10, 55, 58, 679,  109, and 137. Try praying th;em on your own to increase your personal warfare Vocabula&shy;ry.</p>
              <p>Finally, remember that our human enemies  are people who have been entrap&shy;ped by the devil, who has ta&shy;ken them captive  to do his will (2 Tim. 2:26). So let&rsquo;s not pray judgement on these pri&shy;soners  of war. Instead ask God for the heart of a warrior to hate Satan and despite  his demons so that together with Jesus, we can destroy the works of the devil  (John. 3:8).</p>
