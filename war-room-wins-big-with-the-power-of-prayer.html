              With The Power of Prayer</h4>
              <div id="authorname"><!--SECTION LEFT END-->
 </div>
              <p >War Room&rsquo;s Priscilla Shirer  (Elizabeth Jordan) and her husband T.C. Stallings (Tony Jordan) are a couple  who on the surface have it all: solid careers, a beautiful home, and a cute  middle schooler. The reality is quite different than appearances. They live in  a metaphorical &ldquo;war zone&rdquo; and they quite regularly ambush each other with harsh  and cynical words. The couple&rsquo;s main weapon of destruction is a festering anger  that permeates every fragile interaction. Tony treats his wife like an  insurgent; he is irritated (bordering on incensed) at his wife daily. The film  follows the couple with Elizabeth Jordan taking a clear lead as the main  strategist as they reach a peace agreement of sorts.</p>
              <p>Elizabeth,  a real estate agent, meets Miss Clara, an elderly woman, who wants to</p>
              <p>sell her house in which she has  a prayer closet that intrigues Elizabeth. Miss Clara</p>
              <p>encourages her to pray for her  failing marriage. At first, Elizabeth is reticent, but encouraged by Miss  Clara&rsquo;s prayer life and confronted by the grim reality that if she doesn&rsquo;t do  something, her marriage will fall apart, Elizabeth relents. Left alone much of  the time because her husband is often away on business trips, Elizabeth starts  to pray in her own closet. Soon, Elizabeth see&rsquo;s a change in herself and later  in her husband, especially when he is caught stealing from his employer. The  message of the film is that prayer works and for Elizabeth it saved her  marriage.</p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><b>Jesus in War Room</b></p>
              <p>War  Room is the fifth film from Christian filmmaking duo Alex and Stephen Kendrick.  As with their other films,(Flywheel, Facing the Giants,Fireproof, and  Courageous) Jesus is prevalent throughout the movie. War Room illustrates the  power of prayer effectively through dialogue, action and the plot. For  instance, it is the prayers of Elizabeth that help her love and respect her  husband in spite of his shortcomings.</p>
              <p>The  film also explores Biblical themes of forgiveness and mercy. When Tony returns  the pharmaceuticals he stole, his boss has mercy on him and doesn&rsquo;t send him  straight to jail. However, Tony does have to face some consequences for his  actions and pay back the stolen money.</p>
              <p>I  sat in my chair with my feet pressed firmly on the floor ready to cringe at the  boss&rsquo;s decision. Something told me (not sure what) that Tony would get off scot  free which I think contrived. I was somewhat relieved when To&shy;ny had to pay  back the mo&shy;ney he stole. But, then as I drove home from the theatre, I felt  convicted. Even if Tony didn&rsquo;t have to make re&shy;com&shy;pense, that doesn&rsquo;t make his  confession any less admi&shy;ra&shy;ble since he was willing to confess in full light  of the consequences. Thinking it over, if Tony&rsquo;s boss forgave the debt  completely, it would have been alright with me. Debt cancellation is Biblical.  After all, that&rsquo;s what Jesus did for us. </p>

              <p align="center" class="qa"><b>Churches Making Movies 2015</b></p>
              <p>As  you may know, the former Hollywood dominated Box Office experienced a high  jacking of sorts this past few weekends with the theatrical release of War  Room, a film about the power of prayer,and oh, what a strategic time. God is  galvanizing His soldiers in the field of media to make the good news of the  gospel of Jesus more accessible and using an excitingly relevant platform, Mo&shy;vies.  We at the Churches Making Movies Christian Film Festival are leading out by  creating a fo&shy;rum for those who produce, support, and watch Christian  Movies.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Churches  Making Movies is an annual film festival that &ldquo;...celebrates the best in church  produced films.&rdquo; We are happy to be entering our 3rd year with increasing  awareness, attendance, and support from the Body of Christ and even spectators  who are taking notice of the newly emerged excellence in Christian Filmmaking.</p>
              <p>We  believe that God is united The Body of Christ to perform these last few scenes  before the close of time. We also believe that God has strategically aligned  His mem&shy;bers in various markets, industries, locations in order to facilitate  the labor expeditiously. Time and time again God has shown us that each member  will play a major role, and we believe as a Print Media Head you were placed  there for such a time as this. As we partner, we commit to uniting our forces  in media to proclaim the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ as stated in  Matthew 24:14</p>
