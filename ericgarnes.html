            <h4 id="articleTitle">Installation of Bishop Eric D. Garnes</h4>
            <div id="authorname"></div>
      <p >More than 2,500 esteemed clergy and congregants from the United States and beyond witnessed the Installation of the <strong>Most Reverend Eric D. Garnes, D. Min. to the office of Presiding Bishop and General Overseer of the United Covenant Churches of Christ (UCCC)</strong>. Bishop Garnes, senior pastor of Tabernacle of Praise (Cathedral) in East Flatbush, Brooklyn &ndash; known for his exceptionally high standard of excellence &ndash; succeeds Bishop Larry D. Trotter of Chicago, Illinois in office after his resignation in April of this year. The Service of Installation was held on Friday, October 30, 2009 and hosted by Archbishop Eugene J. Blount, Senior Pastor, at The Elim International Fellowship located in Brooklyn, NY. Archbishop-Metropolitan J. Delano Ellis, spiritual father to Bishop Garnes and establishmentarian of UCCC, served as the chief installer. Archbishop Alfred A. Owens delivered the homily.</p>
      <p>The NY State Diocesan Choir, led by gospel music recording artist Renee Credle, ministered the sermonic selection in preparation of the preached Word brought forth by Archbishop Owens of Greater Mount Calvary Holy Church.</p>
      <p>The defining moment was the crowning of Bishop Garnes by his predecessor and spiritual father, Archbishop Ellis who called Bishop Garnes faithful, humble, and a true son. The new Presiding Bishop and General Overseer selected Bishop Sheldon Mandel McCarter of North Carolina who took an oath to assist him in fulfilling his vision for UCCC.</p>
      <p>Celebrated internationally as a prolific preacher, teacher, and scholar of the Gospel, Bishop Garnes&rsquo;s rise to the helm of United is interesting, but not at all surprising. With humble beginnings as a child at Gospel Truth Church of God in a Brooklyn basement, his succession in ministry and the episcopacy has been unique. He served in every capacity from deacon to senior pastor and from adjutant-general to assistant presiding bishop. Unbeknownst to him, he was being prepared over time for the office he now assumes. Garnes faithfully served those preceding him in leadership.</p>
      <p>The road to Primate has not been easy. When he was only three months old, Garnes suffered an illness that caused the doctors to proclaim his inevitable death. The intern told his father and mother to take him home so that he could breathe his last breath. Unwilling to accept such a devastating loss, Alfred and Sonia Garnes immediately took their dying baby to the church. There they came together with the saints and prayed for the life of their child. Like Hannah, mother of the prophet Samuel, when Mrs. Garnes prayed, she made a vow to God. The barren Hannah prayed to conceive a son; Mrs. Garnes sought to keep the son she had. Both of them promised to dedicate their sons to the service of God &ndash; and they did.</p>
      <p>Bishop Garnes&rsquo; commitment to community empowerment, growth, and develop- ment are evident in his local associations. Bishop Garnes&rsquo;s ecclesiastical affiliations include serving as a board member of Bishop T. D. Jakes&rsquo;s PHIPA (Pastoral Alliance) and as Deputy Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Joint College of African-American Bishops comprised of more than 700 bishops internationally.</p>
      <p>United Covenant Churches of Christ is made up of more than 20,000 members globally. UCCC emphasizes the need for and importance of theological and secular academics. It is designing programs to foster higher learning in order to cultivate well-rounded clerical leadership worldwide. Finally, and most importantly, it seeks to develop &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; in the body of Christ based on biblically sound teaching and the principles and culture of God.</p>
