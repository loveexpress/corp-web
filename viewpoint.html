              <p ><strong><em>May 1949 - &ldquo;Happy&rdquo; Rose, father Henry Sr. holding baby brother Henry, Jr.,  Mom Gene&shy;vieve and sister Edith. Brother Richard took the photo.</em></strong><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>On our way  from the Bronx by subway to Manhattan to the Path trains to Newark, then took  the bus up to South Orange Avenue to Newark/  Vailsburg, West End Avenue to Mom&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>Our mom Genevieve Solomine-Acker, a most  beautiful lady married to our Dad, handsome Henry, traveled from Newark to  Mount Vernon, NY to start-up chur&shy;ches.</p>
<p>They had three small children then moved  to the Bronx, into a basement apartment  in a building which they managed. Then they had another child. Six people in 3  small rooms but we made it the best place to live &ldquo;We never asked Mom what we  were going to eat, we just ate what she made.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We were a very loving, hap&shy;py, hugs n  kisses, all the good stuff togetherness devoted Christian family.</p>
<p>Our mother was indeed a great warm,  loving, wife and mom, who never complained even to us.</p>
<p>So we celebrate our mo&shy;</em><em>ther, Genevieve who passed away on May 10, 1988. You gave of yourself  to your husband, children and your Savior, Christ Je&shy;sus.&nbsp; </em><br>
  <strong>Love You Always,</strong><br>
  <strong>Rose, Edith &amp; Henry, Jr. </strong></p>
              <p align="center"><strong class="qa">Mary</strong> </p>
              <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story of Our Lord Jesus Christ  begins with a woman. The Virgin Mary was chosen from all time to have the  greatest privilege a creature could enjoy.</p>
<p>This was God&rsquo;s plan for her. She lived in the little town of Nazareth  and was betrothed to Joseph. Both, though poor, were descen&shy;ded from the royal  race of David. At God&rsquo;s appointed time, the angel Gabriel entered her home and  announced to her God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, thou shalt conceive in  thy womb and shalt bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He  shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High...&rdquo; To Mary,  familiar with the prophecies of the Savior, this could mean only one thing: she  was to become the mo&shy;ther of Christ.</p>
<p>How then could she be a mother since she  knew not man? The angel Gabriel told her of the divine plan, which insured that  she would be the mother of the Anointed One,  yet remain a Virgin.</p>
<p>God planned His Son&rsquo;s birth in this  marvelous way, showing us, once more, the depth of divine wisdom, so far beyond  our understanding. In the midst of life&rsquo;s  trials, this thought should always be with us, for in His Infinite  wisdom, God sees all and knows all. We can see but little part of His plans.  Knowing His Infinite Goodness, we can abandon ourselves to His love and find  His peace that surpasses all understanding. In  all things, God knows best.</p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Eve</strong></p>
              <p align="center">                Adam  named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living,  Genesis 3:20. Eve the first woman had it made. Specially created by God for her  husband. Just as she is the first wo&shy;man, from whom all others spring, Eve&rsquo;s  life speaks to all of us.</p>
