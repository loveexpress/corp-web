              for Racial Reconciliation</h4>
              <div id="authorname"><!--SECTION LEFT END-->
 </div>
              <p >These days, as people around the  nation become more aware of racial injustice, many young Christians of all  races are eager to be part of the solution.</p>
              <p>That&rsquo;s  great news; we need every available hand on deck! But since so many of us have  grown up in ra&shy;cially isolated communities, many of us don&rsquo;t know what racial  reconciliation looks like, what it requires of us, or how to work toward it. If  we&rsquo;re not careful, our lack of understanding can 1) paralyze us, preventing us  from taking steps toward reconciliation, or 2) cause us to jump onto the racial  reconciliation bandwagon without any direction or intentionality.</p>
              <p>The  good news is there&rsquo;s a third option. Just about anyone can be a racial  reconciler, and it&rsquo;s never too late to start. But it takes effort, sacrifice  and a whole lot of heart. Here&rsquo;s where I suggest you begin:</p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Know the Truth.</strong></p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s  tempting to think that reconciliation is a pie-in-the-sky multiracial kumbaya  sing -along in which people of all colors croon together in perfect harmony.  That would make a fabulous Broadway number, but that&rsquo;s not racial  reconciliation.</p>
              <p>Thankfully,  reconciliation is much more profound and beautiful. In the Greek, re&shy;conciliation  is katallass&#333; which literally means &ldquo;to change, or exchange; to effect a  change.&rdquo; The word ka&shy;tallass&#333; is often used by the apostle Paul to  describe the restoration that can occur af&shy;ter two groups have been at odds  (e.g., Romans 5:1-11).</p>
              <p>Through  the process of reconciliation, two groups that were once alienated from each  other begin to identify with each other and stand in solidarity. This is a tall  order! In a world that is plagued by racial division and inequality,  reconciliation requires a profound change in the way we interact with each  other. Groups (e.g., black &amp; whites) that are accustomed to having little  firsthand knowledge of each other must learn to not only know each other, but  identify with each other. Groups that are accustomed to being at odds with each  other must acknowledge the grievances and then do what it takes to make peace.</p>
              <p>Reconciliation  is not for the faint of heart&mdash;but when it actually occurs, it is truly  spectacular and well worth the effort.</p>
              <p><strong><u>We&rsquo;re not meant to ignore our racial  differen&shy;ces; we&rsquo;re meant to identify and embrace them so that we can know how  our identities uniquely contribute to the larger puzzle of the family of God.</u></strong></p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Embrace Your</strong> <strong>Racial Identity.</strong></p>
              <p>Many  people wrongly believe it&rsquo;s easier to achieve racial reconciliation if we  ignore our racial identities. In other words, we think &ldquo;not seeing color&rdquo; is  the best pathway to racial harmony. But to take this approach would be a huge  mistake because God created us with different skin color, physical features and  family lineages. So racial re&shy;concilers must engage in courageous  self-examination:</p>
              <p>&bull; What does it mean for me to be white, black,  Asian and/or Hispanic?</p>
              <p>&bull; What is my racial heritage and history?</p>
              <p>&bull; What is my racial culture and how is it  expressed?</p>
              <p>&bull; What are the common experiences of my race?</p>
              <p>&bull; What does society say about my race? What  does God say? Which one do I be&shy;lieve?</p>
              <p>&bull; What does it mean for me to genuinely  express my ra&shy;cial identity?</p>
              <p>&bull; How does God want to use my white, black,  Asian and/ or Hispanic identity to reconcile people to each other and to God?</p>
              <p>We&rsquo;re  not meant to ignore our racial differences; we&rsquo;re meant to identify and embrace  them so that we can know how our identities uniquely contribute to the larger  puzzle of the family of God. We don&rsquo;t need identical puzzle pieces; we need uni&shy;que  ones.</p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Confront Your Privilege and / or Oppression.</strong></p>
              <p>Reconciliation  begins with the acknowledgment that we live in a broken world, one that is  plagued by racial inequality. In our society, whites are privileged; whites are  accommodated while non-whites are alienated.</p>
              <p>One  example of this is the well-known Jamal and Lakisha study, in which researchers  sent identical r&eacute;sum&eacute;s to numerous compa- nies all over the U.S. The only thing  they changed on the r&eacute;sum&eacute; was the name. They used common &ldquo;white&rdquo; names (e.g.,  Greg and Emi&shy;ly) or common &ldquo;black&rdquo; names (Jamal and Lakisha). The researchers  found that when name on the r&eacute;sum&eacute; was Emily or Greg, the hiring managers at  the company were significantly more likely to invite Emily or Greg in for an  interview than when the r&eacute;sum&eacute; name was Jamal or Lakisha. This study is simply  one of many studies that de&shy;monstrates the existence of white privilege.</p>
              <p><strong><u>Racial  reconciliation isn&rsquo;t a goal; it&rsquo;s a way of life. The way of the reconciler  requires constant self-sacrifice and self-giving.</u></strong></p>
              <p>As  racial reconcilers, we must not only see inequality in the abstract, we must  also see how inequality affects us personally. This means that whites must  examine and acknowledge the ways in which society privileges them, and  non-whites must examine and acknowledge the ways in which society oppresses  them, to varying degrees. Both whites and non-whites must recognize the ways in  which their advancement through life (e.g., getting into college, avoiding the  penal system, getting promoted, earning money, etc.) is propelled by racial  privilege and / or thwarted by racial op&shy;pres&shy;sion.</p>
              <p>This  is crucial; when we see how racial inequality personally affects us, we are  better able to fight for equali&shy;ty.</p>
              <p align="center" class="qa"><strong>Count the Cost.</strong></p>
              <p>Everybody  desires ra&shy;cial reconciliation, but few people are willing to pay for it.  Reconciliation work is costly because it is the work of the Cross. We kid  ourselves if we think we can enjoy restored relationships without paying the  price for them.</p>
              <p>Jesus  our Great Reconciler knew this all too well. His pursuit of reconciliation led  to His death, so we could enjoy relationship with God. Reconcilers have the  honor of following in Jesus&rsquo; footsteps, but we also must recognize that  reconciliation will lead to our own deaths. We may not experience physical  death as reconcilers (although that is possible), but we will certainly  experience other forms of death: death of cultural idolatry, comfort,  individualism, narrow-min&shy;ded perspectives, personal- or group-based power,  control, ethnocentricity, certainty and more. I&rsquo;m not going to lie. I can tell  you from experience that these deaths can be excruciating.</p>
              <p>Racial  reconciliation isn&rsquo;t a goal; it&rsquo;s a way of life. The way of the reconciler  requires constant self-sacrifice and self-giving. It leads to places and  experiences that will stun you in both terrifying and beautiful ways.  Reconciliation costs everything but, like the Cross, it also offers everything.  I&rsquo;ve never known more freedom, joy and intimacy with God and others than I&rsquo;ve  known in the midst of the excruciating and magnificent work of reconciliation.  It truly is what we were created to do.</p>
              <p>Jesus  began his journey of reconciliation by leaving the comfort and familiarity of  the Trinity, embarking on a cross-cultural mission to Earth, identifying with  us and making the burdens of humanity His own. We begin our journeys of  reconciliation by doing the same&mdash;by leaving the comfort and familiarity of our  racially isolated worlds, engaging across ra&shy;cial lines, identifying with  people of other races and making their burdens our own.</p>
              <p>How  this specifically plays out will vary from person to person. Depending on your  racial identity, geogra&shy;phic location, social status and individual  characteristics, God will call you to different tasks as a reconciler. The good  news is that Christians, particularly people of color, have been doing racial  reconciliation work for years. Find a group in your region, listen, learn and  follow the leadership. There is much work to be done and much peace to be made!</p>
