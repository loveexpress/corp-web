            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Brian Kisler, Youth Pastor, VanNest AOG</p>
            </div>
      <p >What a time and day we live in it is like no other time in history. When one looks at the progress in society you can&rsquo;t help but notice the increased awareness of what is going on in our world today and what is taking place in people minds, bodies, and emotions Whether by watching a movie like &ldquo;Blood Diamond,&rdquo; catching CNN, reading the side of a Starbucks cup, or looking up investments that are socially conscious we are at least aware of what is going on in the world in away that has never before been possible. We are aware of overwhelmingly high rates of depression and diabetes, as we are able to identify and detect them earlier in their progression. Having a child of my own on the autistic spectrum has opened my eyes to the fact that there are 600 more times the people diagnosed with autism than there are all the forms of cancer combined and yet there is only about $1.00 per person going into research for autistic causes and cures. Young people are constantly bombarded with statistics about everything from the effects of playing too many hours of video games to the reality that there are more than 25 sexually transmitted diseases today compared to just 1 in 1972. So with all this awareness why does it seem that the problems are only growing worse? With the increased knowledge why are so many people still failing to live physically, emotionally, relationally healthy lives? Why with so many facts and statistics does the world continue to abuse drugs, sex, and each other as if there will be no lasting consequence?</p>
      <p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; John 3:14 &amp;15 Yes we live in a day of increased awareness in so many ways and we have gathered so much information that shows the need for change, but we don&rsquo;t lift up Jesus. Let me explain I often hear people in ministry to young people destroying, dissecting, and disapproving everything that young people are really digging and I believe that the tactic is all wrong. You say, what? I said the approach is wrong you have to see that they are coming from a perspective of this is what I can identify with, this is what I am feeling, this helps me to cope, this my way of escaping. I believe the more we attack the more we belittle, the more we belittle, the more we condemn, and the more we condemn the more we lose for eternity. Let me ask you a few questions. If statistics were going to convince young people to stop doing things why are they still doing them? If disrespecting what they value could change their lives wouldn&rsquo;t they have changed by now? If drawing attention to the dark decrepit, and destructive media were going to have any lasting impact why haven&rsquo;t we felt it? We need to start a mission of increasing the awareness of JESUS CHRIST!</p>
      <p>The problem is that we draw attention away from Christ and put it on the devil and his works of darkness. When you enter a room and turn on a light where do your eyes turn when the light comes on &ndash; towards the light. Once you are aware of the light and where it is coming from you start doing the things that you need to do. It is time that we turn the light on in our youth ministries &ndash; it is time to make our young people aware of who Christ is and what His plan is for their lives &ndash; we will never see it as long as we focus on the dark and refuse to elevate JESUS. So how do we get this generation to become aware of Jesus? How do we increase their awareness of who they are in God and who God is in them? How do we bring them to a place of being aware that God has an awesome purpose for their lives?</p>
      <p>I want to conclude this article by listing ten things we must do to increase the awareness of Jesus in our ministries:</p>
      <p>10 &ndash; We must point to Jesus Christ as the way, the truth, and the life in our teaching and preaching.</p>
      <p>9 &ndash; We must focus our lives on Jesus and His word not just the information available on current trends.</p>
      <p>8 &ndash; We must place a high value on seeking God and His plan for the lives of the teens.</p>
      <p>7 &ndash; We must do everything we can to give them music that they will like and focuses them on Christ.</p>
      <p>6 &ndash; We must educate them on how living a life of obedience towards God protects them from the consequences of sin.</p>
      <p>5 &ndash; We must make sure that our ministries encourage those teens that lift Jesus up and that we don&rsquo;t place all our attention on those who seek to get attention and disrupt the flow of God&rsquo; Spirit.</p>
      <p>4 &ndash; We must show young people that God is aware of who they are by being involved with their lives.</p>
      <p>3 &ndash; We must decrease their awareness of our importance and increase their awareness of His importance in their lives.</p>
      <p>2 &ndash; We must shy away from blasting the world and instead unashamedly declare Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>
      <p>1 &ndash; We must never forget the work of the cross lifting high the Son of Man so that all who believe will have eternal life.</p>
