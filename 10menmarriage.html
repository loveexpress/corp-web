                My wife  and I raised four daughters&mdash;without shotguns in the house!&mdash;and three of them  have already married. We love our sons-in-law, and it&rsquo;s obvious God handpicked  each of them to match our daughters&rsquo; temperaments and personality.
              <p>I have always believed God is in the  matchmaking business. If He can do it for my daughters, He can do it for you.</p>
              <p>Today I have several single female  friends who would very much like to find the right guy. Some tell me the  pickings are slim at their church, so they have ventured into the world of  online dating. Others have thrown up their hands in despair, wondering if there  are any decent Christian guys left anywhere.  They&rsquo;ve begun to wonder if they should lower their standards in order to find a  mate.</p>
              <p>My advice stands: Don't settle for less  than God's best. Too many Christian women today have ended up with an Ishmael  because impatience pushed them into an unhappy marriage. Please take my  fatherly advice: You are much better off single than with the wrong guy!</p>
              <p>Speaking of &ldquo;wrong guys,&rdquo; here are the  top 10 men you should avoid when looking for a husband:</p>
              
              <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>The unbeliever.</strong> Please write 2 Corinthians 6:14 on a Post-it note  and tack it on your computer at work. It says, &ldquo;Do not be bound together with  unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what  fellowship has light with darkness?&rdquo; (NASB). This is not an outdated religious  rule. It is the Word of God for you today.</p>
              <p>Don&rsquo;t allow a man&rsquo;s charm, looks or  financial success (or his willingness to go to church with you) push you to  compromise what you know is right. &ldquo;Missionary dating&rdquo; is never a wise  strategy. If the guy is not a born-again Christian, scratch him off your list.  He&rsquo;s not right for you. I&rsquo;ve yet to meet a Christian woman who didn&rsquo;t regret  marrying an unbeliever.</p>
              
              <p><strong>2. The liar.</strong> If you  discover that the man you are dating has lied to you about his past or that  he&rsquo;s always covering his tracks to hide his secrets from you, run for the  nearest exit. Marriage must be built on a foundation of trust. If he can&rsquo;t be  truthful, break up now before he bamboozles you with an even bigger deception.</p>
              
              <p><strong>3. The playboy.</strong> I wish I  could say that if you meet a nice guy at church, you can assume he&rsquo;s living in  sexual purity. But that&rsquo;s not the case today. I&rsquo;ve heard horror stories about  single guys who serve on the worship team on Sunday but act like Casanovas  during the week. If you marry a guy who was sleeping around before your  wedding, you can be sure he will be sleeping around after your wedding.</p>
              
              <p><strong>4. The deadbeat.</strong> There  are many solid Christian men who experienced marital failure years ago. Since  their divorce, they have experienced the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s restoration, and now  they want to remarry. Second marriages can be very happy. But if you find out  that the man you are dating hasn&rsquo;t been caring for his children from a previous  marriage, you have just exposed a fatal flaw. Any man who will not pay for his  past mistakes or support children from a previous marriage is not going to  treat you responsibly.</p>
              
              <p><strong>5. The addict.</strong> Churchgoing men who have addictions to alcohol or drugs have learned to hide  their problems&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t want to wait until your honeymoon to find out that  he&rsquo;s a boozer. Never marry a man who refuses to get help for his addiction.  Insist that he get professional help and walk away. And don&rsquo;t get into a  codependent relationship in which he claims he needs you to stay sober. You  can&rsquo;t fix him.</p>
              
              <p><strong>6. The bum.</strong> I have a  female friend who realized after she married her boyfriend that he had no plans  to find steady work. He had devised a great strategy: He stayed home all day  and played video games while his professional wife worked and paid all the  bills. The apostle Paul told the Thessalonians, &ldquo;If anyone is not willing to  work, then he is not to eat, either&rdquo; (2 Thess. 3:10). The same rule applies  here: If a man is not willing to work, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve to marry you.</p>
              
              <p><strong>7. The narcissist.</strong> I  sincerely hope you can find a guy who is handsome. But be careful: If your  boyfriend spends six hours a day at the gym and regularly posts closeups of his  biceps on Facebook, you have a problem. Do not fall for a self-absorbed guy. He  might be cute, but a man who is infatuated with his appearance and his own  needs will never be able to love you sacrificially, like Christ loves the  church (Eph. 5:25). The man who is always looking at himself in the mirror will  never notice you.</p>
              
              <p><strong>8. The abuser.</strong> Men with  abusive tendencies can&rsquo;t control their anger when it boils over. If the guy you  are dating has a tendency to fly off the handle, either at you or others, don&rsquo;t  be tempted to rationalize his behavior. He has a problem, and if you marry him  you will have to navigate his minefield every day to avoid triggering another  outburst. Angry men hurt women&mdash;verbally and sometimes physically. Find a man  who is gentle.</p>
              
              <p><strong>9. The man-child.</strong> Call me  old-fashioned, but I&rsquo;m suspicious of a guy who still lives with his parents at  age 35. If his mother is still doing his cooking, cleaning and ironing at that  age, you can be sure he&rsquo;s stuck in an emotional time warp. You are asking for  trouble if you think you can be a wife to a guy who hasn&rsquo;t grown up. Back away  and, as a friend, encourage him to find a mentor who can help him mature.</p>
              
              <p><strong>10. The control freak.</strong> Some  Christian guys today believe marriage is about male superiority. They may quote  Scripture and sound super-spiritual, but behind the fa&ccedil;ade of husbandly  authority is deep insecurity and pride that can morph into spiritual abuse.  First Peter 3:7 commands husbands to treat their wives as equals. If the man  you are dating talks down to you, makes demeaning comments about women or seems  to squelch your spiritual gifts, back away now. He is on a power trip. Women  who marry religious control freaks often end up in a nightmare of depression.</p>
              <p>If you are a woman of God, don&rsquo;t sell  your spiritual birthright by marrying a guy who doesn&rsquo;t deserve you. Your  smartest decision in life is to wait for a man who is sold out to Jesus.</p>
