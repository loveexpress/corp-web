              <p>There are  many people without whose help, support and guidance this book would never have  seen the light of day. First, I thank God  for giving my family and me the breath of life and strength so that we may  persevere through all of life&rsquo;s challenges.</p>
              <p>I would like to thank all of the very  special people who&rsquo;ve had a huge influence on my life. Their encouraging words  continually help me.</p>
              <p>I especially want to thank my immediate  family, - starting with my brothers. We&rsquo;ve gone through something that would make  most families lose their minds. But we were taught how to pray and how to trust  God. We&rsquo;ve made it through and God Almighty gets the glory. Let&rsquo;s keep striving  and pushing to be the best we can be. Every accomplishment puts another stamp  on this great le&shy;gacy. At the same time we serve notice to the Devil that  nothing he tries will work. No weapon formed against us shall prosper.</p>
              <p>A hearty shout out to my loving wife,  &ldquo;Gee.&rdquo; I thank you for allowing God to completely reconfigure your entire  being. I love you and much more joy is to come.</p>
              <p>Thanks to my children Rocky, Jasmine and  Jai. I love you guys.. Most kids will never endure what you have gone through.  A lot of times people forget that you lost your grandparents. But God has  covered you, and even through the tears you stayed strong. I love you. And I&rsquo;m  so proud of each and every one of you. God Bless!</p>
              <p>Pastor  John David Wright</p>
              <p><em>Grace Tabernacle Church of God In Christ,  Brooklyn, NY</em></p>
              <p>I have been the Pastor of Grace  Tabernacle for six years now. My family and I have had time to breathe and  settle into our new roles. I also have had a lot of time to think - and to  heal!</p>
              <p>My main reason for writing this book is  to help people forgive those that have done them wrong, and to forgive any evil  acts that have come into their lives.</p>
              <p>You can&rsquo;t move on until you forgive. And  the Bible teaches us that there is Po&shy;wer in Forgiveness. If we don&rsquo;t forgive  others, how can we expect God to forgive us?</p>
              <p>You may ask, &ldquo;What gives me the right to  teach anyone, or even to talk about forgiveness? What made me an expert on  forgiveness?&rdquo; Many of you also may ask, &ldquo;Who do I have to forgive?&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Let me take you back a little bit. I&rsquo;m  sure that many of you may remember what happened to my family, to me, and to  the world, on July 4th, 2008. I am referring to the tragic, untimely deaths of  my father, the late great,Timothy Wright, my  mother, Betty Wright, and my nephew, Da&shy;niel Wright Jr. (DJ) in a  horrific car crash. Neither my family, nor I,  ever experienced anything as catastrophic as that in our entire lives.</p>
              <p>I remember that day - just like it was  yesterday. We were all in Detroit at the Church of God in Christ&rsquo;s AIM  Convention. I was there with my group, the DW Project. And so were three of my  brothers: Danny, Derrick and Dwayne, along with my parents, &shy;Timothy and Betty.</p>
              <p>My nephew DJ also was there. He just had  graduated from junior high school, and it was a gift for him to be able to  travel to Detroit with my parents.</p>
              <p>Our group performed a concert on the  night of July 3rd at the convention center in Detroit. We decided that we were  going to return to New York right afterwards. Our original plan was for all of  us - including my wife, kids, my parents and my nephew to leave together. Buy  my wife and I wanted to leave a little earlier (without my parents and DJ)  because I had some singers who needed to get home for their cookouts and other  July 4th Holiday activities. We left the hotel about 4am. I drove with my wife  Geneatha, and kids, Rocky, Jasmine and Jai in one SUV: my singers were in  another SUV.</p>
              <p>My parents also were leaving that day,  but not until about 10 in the morning. So by the time I arrived in New York,  they were really just getting on the road. My mom made various telephone calls from the car, including one to my  brother Donny, in North Carolina, and told him that they were on their way. She  promised him that she would call when they got home. Mom then called me but I  didn&rsquo;t pick up the phone because I was sleeping, trying to get over that long  drive. Then she called my brother Danny, DJ&rsquo;s father, and said, &ldquo;We are on our  way. DJ should be home by one am. He&rsquo;ll just spend the night with us, so you  ain&rsquo;t gotta come get him.&rdquo; Then everybody was at peace. The last phone call my  mother made was at 10:30pm. The accident happened at 10:45pm.</p>
              <p>The next call we got was from my  sister-in-law Lori, telling us that there had been an accident. It was about  one o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Lori screamed, &ldquo;They have been in an accident!&rdquo; I  asked, &ldquo;Well, how bad is it? What happened?&rdquo; Nobody knew how bad it was. She  said, &ldquo;The police didn&rsquo;t give us any information. They just said, &ldquo;They got in  an accident.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t even tell us what hospital they were in. I knew  approximately where the hospital was since I had recently dri&shy;ven home on the same route. I knew what  direction I need&shy;ed to go. So I just jumped in my car, left my family at home  and drove there as fast as I could.</p>
              <p>On my way I  was getting more information, including the name of the hospital  in Pennsylvania. It&rsquo;s normally a three hour drive but it took me two hours, on  a wet highway. God got me there safely.</p>
              <p>At the hospital I asked a woman at the  information desk, &ldquo;Do you have Timothy Wright here?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s  here, but you can&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Frantically, I said, &ldquo;You must let me  see him. He&rsquo;s a very prominent man. When word gets out that he&rsquo;s here, a lot of  people are gonna flock to this hospital.&rdquo; Again I repeated, &ldquo;You must let me  see him, I&rsquo;m his son, David Wright.&rdquo; Then she said, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll let you see  him.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>I asked, &ldquo;Who else do you have? Do you  have Da&shy;niel Wright, Jr.?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s in the pediatric ward.&rdquo; And I  asked, &ldquo;What about Betty Wright?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t have Bet&shy;ty Wright  here.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Before they took me to see my father,  they let me see my nephew DJ. He was unresponsive, and I had pra&shy;yer with him.  Tragically he was just completely brain dead. No activity at all.Still alive,  but a machine was breathing for him. A chaplain and I went to see my father.  And there were many people vigorously working on him. It was overwhelming! I  was really frightened because I didn&rsquo;t know if my father was alive or dead.  They were trying to revive him and at the same time stabilize him. He had on a neck brace. His legs were crushed. He was  in very bad condition, unresponsive, not speaking, not conscious at all.  And I prayed with him.</p>
              <p>Afterwards I asked nur&shy;ses and doctors,  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my mom?&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know about any other person. They only  brought these two people here.&rdquo; I kept walking back and forth between the  pediatric ward and my father&rsquo;s room.</p>
              <p>Finally, one of our congregant members  who lived in the Pennsylvania area arrived. While he was walking with me down  the hall his phone rang. And then he didn&rsquo;t say anything. Immediate&shy;ly  afterwards my wife &ldquo;Gee&rdquo; called me crying and  screaming. She had just received a phone call that my mom was dead. So  that&rsquo;s how I found out that my mom had died. In an instant I passed out and hit  the floor!</p>
              <p>There was a rumor that I had a heart  attack. That was not true. There were so many different rumors going around.  This day marked the beginning of a long, hard time for the Wright family.</p>
              <p>The next day a police officer came and  explained everything. He even gave us the name of the drunk driver that hit  them. John Hicks, Jr. had collided with them head on. The officer said,  quietly, &ldquo;Your mom died instantly.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>I was told that Hicks was drunk. And the  collision was unbelievably forceful. He was doing about 80 miles per hour and  driving with no lights. My father was coming down the hill doing 70.</p>
              <p>I was told that everyone had a seatbelt  on except for my father. My mom had a seatbelt on and my nephew had a seatbelt  on. Ironically my father was the only one who survived the crash.</p>
              <p>The driver, John Hicks, was crushed so  badly that they had to just cover his car with a sheet. They couldn&rsquo;t even  remove him at the scene. They had to remove his body somewhere else.</p>
              <p>My brother Donny, living in North  Carolina, and my younger brothers Dwayne and Derrick were not immediately  available. Therefore, as I said earlier, I became the spokesperson for the  family. In an interview with one of the reporters who worked for a Pennsylvania  newspaper, he asked me, &ldquo;How do you feel about John Hicks, Jr.?&rdquo;</p>
              <p>I told him, &ldquo;I am a Christian. I know  what my dad and mom taught me. We have to forgive him.&rdquo; So I forgave him. I&rsquo;m  mad, I&rsquo;m an&shy;gry; I wish this didn&rsquo;t happen, but I forgive that man. Because if  I don&rsquo;t forgive him, it will continue to eat at me for the rest of my life.  I&rsquo;ve learned to forgive . But, believe me, at first I was not in a forgiving  mood. I was an&shy;gry. I wanted to fight. My bro&shy;thers and I wanted to fight. We  wanted to punish that man. If he wasn&rsquo;t dead, we wanted to kill him. If he  wasn&rsquo;t hurt, we wanted to hurt him. The fact that he was dead helped quench our  rage. It helped to forgive because we could not act out our desires since he  was no longer alive.</p>
              <p>We could not have an argument with him. We could not fight. I  empathize and sympathize with those who are victims of drunk driving and the  drunk driver survives. Now you have someone that you can literally direct your  anger toward.</p>
              <p>What helped me is that I didn&rsquo;t have a  person that I could actually go to and grab and say, &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
              <p>So God gave me the ability to forgive  him. It took a couple of days because I was still sitting there with my father.  And I&rsquo;m thinking to myself: this is not his fault, my dad did nothing wrong,  and my mom is gone, and my nephew is gone. They had done nothing wrong. They  were driving on the right side of the road.</p>
              <p>But that man did the wrong thing! I&rsquo;m  angry! I&rsquo;m mad! But in order for me to go forward and be there for my dad who was  critically injured and slowly in a state of recovery,  I had to forgive him.</p>
              <p>I was first to  forgive John Hicks. My dad forgave him later. He did not come to  until three days after the crash. And even when he did come to, we couldn&rsquo;t  give him all the details. He didn&rsquo;t know what had happened. He kept looking for  my mom, his wife. We couldn&rsquo;t tell him, &ldquo;Dad, mom&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; Paralyzed from his  shoulders down that would&rsquo;ve made his condition even worse. So we withheld that information from him for about  two weeks. But then we had to tell him because every day he kept whispering the  best that he could, &ldquo;Where is your mo&shy;ther?&rdquo;</p>
