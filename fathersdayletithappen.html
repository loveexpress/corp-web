              <p>This  annual celebration seems far too seldom. For if one has been favored with the  blessings of a good father in their life, there is a need to celebrate every  single day. Our father, Eve&shy;rett C. Newsome, Sr., also known as Bishop Everett  C. Newsome, I, causes his children, and those that know him to celebrate  consistently.&nbsp; </p>
             <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic">
              <img src="images/bishopeverettc.newsome.jpg" alt="Bishop Everett C. Newsome I" width="280" height="300" title="Bishop Everett C. Newsome I"></div>
              <p>Our father was born in&nbsp; 1924 in Brooklyn, NY, the fourth of five  children. He experienced the death of his father due to pneumonia before the  tender age of five years old. At this time due to hardship, his mother felt the  need to separate her three youn&shy;ger sons for the betterment of survival. The  oldest of the three to a patriarchal aunt to be raised as her son, our father  was sent to Barbados, W.I. to be raised by his matriarchal uncle, and the youn&shy;gest son kept by mo&shy;ther.</p>
              <p>Dad, our father, also called &ldquo;Daddy,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Poppa&rdquo;, &ldquo;Poppa-Daddy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pop-Pop&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; &ldquo;By-shop,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pop&rdquo;, has shared that  there were some favorable and unfavorable acts of treatment toward him during  those early years. Those acts though, especially the unfavorable ones, did not  foster an attitude of hatred and arrogance, but with the gentle spirit that God  gave him, they generated a determined attitude of love and hospitality. This we  have noted from his younger cou&shy;sins, the children of his uncle, who speak of  Dad and interact with such love and adoration toward him that it truly warms  our hearts. This love and hospitality has been constant in our home and in the  church.</p>
<div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic">
              <img src="images/bishopeverettc.newsome2.jpg" alt="Bishop Everett C. Newsome I" width="280" height="362" title="Bishop Everett C. Newsome I"></div>
                <p>After a period of 17 years, Dad returned  to the United States. Upon returning he  met a friend who invited him to church (Pentecostal) and also introduced him to  Mother Louise Atherly and her family. The Pentecostal faith proved to be a new  horizon for Dad, since the Newsome&rsquo; roots were grounded in the Anglican/Episcopal faith till this day. Over the years he  would reminisce of how he was nurtured by Mother Atherly in the scriptures  along with wonderful meals and joyous family interaction. During the summer of  1947 Dad responded to an altar call at the Emmanuel Christian Mission Church and accepted Christ as his savior,  thereafter continuing to go to church regularly. He was baptized and became a full pledged member. He also participated in a group named The National  Young People&rsquo;s Organization of Greater New York. This group formed an  evangelistic committee to conduct services within the participating churches;  he was appointed and served as vice president  of this committee.</p>
              <p>The president of this committee, a young  deacon at the time, introduced Dad to the deacon&rsquo;s favorite cou&shy;sin, Sister  Olga Gwendolyn Howell. Although they met in 1948, they became friendly in the  early part of 1949. Dad and Mom were engaged in the late summer of 1949, and united in marriage on December 3rd,  1949. </p>
              <p>When first married, they lived in  Manhattan, but later moved to Queens in 1957, yet still continuing to go to  church in Manhattan. This became tiresome and  promp- ted them to look around Queens for a church, for them and the  children God had blessed them with, to fellowship in. While conducting prayer  meetings they were moved in 1967 to orga&shy;nize the Saint Albans Gospel Assembly,  which is still vibrant and growing today.</p>
              <p>Throughout all this we have witnessed and  daily can testify that Dad loves his children dearly; his wife (deceased June  2005), his family beyond measure and is still actively attending church weekly  and in the week also. He has made certain to be with us for daily meals except  when he was at work, present at recitals, little league, graduations for  children and grandchildren. He could not attend our brother, Kim&rsquo;s +high school  graduation exercise on the 3rd Sunday in June 1981, Dad had to speak at church  for &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; but Mom atten&shy;ded the exercises. We&rsquo;ve seen him increase in  abundant wisdom perpetually.</p>
              <p><b>On  Sunday, July 6th, 2014 at 4pm at Antun&rsquo;s Ca&shy;terers, 96-43  Springfield Blvd., Queens Village, NY 11429 we will celebrate Dad&rsquo;s 90th  birthday. Tickets for this event are $100.00. Please contact Angie  Garrick @ 718-781-0513, e-mail: angiegarrick@msn.com  or Assoc. Pastor Ly&shy;nette Drayton @ 917  723-2301, or ldrayton50@yahoo.com for further  info.</b></p>
              <p>Thank God for Dad, our trea&shy;sure.</p>
