            <div id="authorname">
                <p>by Horace Batson, Ph.D.<br />
                Welstar Publications</p>
            </div>
              <p>Many of the readers of <strong>The Love Express</strong> have heard about that tragic highway accident that left our beloved famous gospel performer and pastor <strong>Timothy Wright</strong> paralyzed and both his wife, Betty and Grandson fatally injured.</p>
              <p>What you may not know about are the events that  immediately preceded the accident. In December 2006 the author <strong>Dr. Horace Batson</strong>, Publisher with Welstar Publications (Brooklyn based Christian publishing company - visit us at <a href="http://www.welstarpublications.com">www.welstarpublications.com</a>, 718-453-6557,  was invited to attend a gospel performance held at Brooklyn&rsquo;s New Life Tabernacle where Bishop Michael A. Mitchell is the pastor.</p>
              <p>When I arrived I was escorted to the front pews and was amazed that there was standing room only. Suddenly Bishop Mitchell announced the next guest as Timothy Wright, a name with which I was not familiar. The ground broke into riotous applause as he came before the die hard fans. He sang his signature songs -  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Whose Really On The Lord&rsquo;s Side and others.</p>
              <p>As he sang I turned to look at the crowd in the rear of the church. They all knew the words and appeared were entranced as if his words carried them to a far better place. I felt at peace with Timothy Wright distinctive rendition of  Jesus, Jesus Jesus.</p>
              <p>It was then that I knew that I wanted to publish Timothy Wright&rsquo;s book. I wanted to share in his life. I wanted the world to not only hear his words through his songs - I wanted them to know about Timothy Wright and his incredible life</p>
              <p>I called him and told him what I wanted to do. He immediately embraced the idea. Unlike many other of our authors he wanted to start right away. He called me day and night as we recorded countless stories about his fascinating experiences with other world class singers, song writers, composers, music industry moguls  and others in the gospel and secular business.</p>
              <p>I could not help but notice his sense of emergency. We had to get his story down right away not later. I could only obey. For I was so intrigued by the stories and the utter sense of let&rsquo;s not waste time, which is just the opposite in the world of publishing.</p>
              <p>Timothy Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;Whose Really On The Lords&rsquo;s Side&quot;  Four Decades of Gospel Music Ministry with the Foreword by Rev. Al  Sharpton was published in May 2008.</p>
              <p>I had the honor of attending the COGIC AIM convention in Detroit this past June with Timothy Wright, his wife Betty and their grandson. They all helped with making sure that the many fans got  a copy of Timothy&rsquo;s book. Here I witnessed the popularity of Timothy Wright. He sat on his chair and autographed each copy of the book for his admiring faithful fans.</p>
              <p>Since things were going so well I returned to New York. I was shocked to hear about the accident that weekend. I was as many in a state of disbelief.</p>
              <p>Since then Rev. Wright is now paralyzed. He is at Kessler Hospital in West Orange NJ. He goes for physical therapy every day. His mood is positive and spirits high. He now attends his church with supervision for Sunday service.</p>
              <p>Remarkably both Rev. Wright and his family have forgiven the drunk driver who also was killed in the accident. We are praying that he will one day sing again.</p>
              <p>The projected cost for his treat is $4,000 a day. His injury requires at least 4 months of treatment with a total projected cost of $480,000.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, Timothy does not have medical insurance. Therefore, in order to help pay the hospital bills Rev. Wright and his family are offering a complimentary copy of his book Whose Really On The Lords&rsquo;s Side Four Decades of Gospel Music Ministry with the Foreword by Rev. Al  Sharpton  for a donation of $50.00 or more.</p>
              <p>Checks in the amount of $1000.00 or more should be made payable to; Timothy Wright Trust. Checks under $1000.00 should be made payable to Rev. Timothy Wright. All checks should be mailed to:</p>
