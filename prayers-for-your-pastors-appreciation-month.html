              Prayers For Your Pastor</h4>
              <div id="authorname">by Nancy Leigh DeMoss<br>
              </div>
              <p align="center"><i>&ldquo;Brothers, pray for us.&rdquo;</i> <i>(1 Thess 5:25 ESV)</i></p>
              <p>Let the thought sink deep into  the heart of every church, that their minister will be such a minister as their  prayers make him... How perilous is the condition of that minister... whose  heart is not encouraged, whose hands are not strengthened, and who is not  upheld by the prayers of his people! </p>
              <p>&ldquo;It  is at a fearful expense that ministers are ever allowed to enter the pulpit  without being preceded, accompanied, and followed by the earnest prayers of the  churches. It is no marvel that the pulpit is so powerless, and ministers so  often disheartened when there are so few to hold up their hands. . . . When the  churches cease to pray for ministers, ministers will no longer be a blessing to  the churches.&rdquo; Gardiner Spring (1785&ndash;1873)</p>
              <p>There  is no greater gift you can give your pastor and the spiritual leaders of your  church than to pray for them.</p>
              <p>Pastors cannot win the battle  alone; they need committed intercessors to lift them up in fervent, specific  prayer. Ima&shy;gine how the power of God might be released in our churches if we  were to pray faithfully for our pastors.</p>
              <p>Pastors  are human&mdash;they face the same challen&shy;ges that their people do, with some  additional ones! They grow tired in ministry, are tempted to sin, and may find  it difficult to balance their many roles and responsibilities. They need the  encouragement and support of those they lead.</p>
              <p>Prayer  for your pastor is crucial to the spiritual health of your pastor, his family,  and your church. God will reward your efforts to cover him in prayer. If you  want to encourage your spiritual leaders (and their wives!), let them know you  are praying for them. Ask them periodically for any specific prayer requests,  and assure them you will pray accordingly. Use the following prayer guide with  accompanying scriptures that suggest practical ways to pray for those who  provide spiritual leadership for the flock.</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that your pastor will counsel and teach with discernment through the wise use  of Scripture and faith in God&rsquo;s power to work. Pray that he will be protected  from the effects of sinful or negative attitudes that he encounters as he  counsels. (Mal.2:7; James 1:5&ndash;6; John 17:15)</p>
              <p>Ask  God to protect your pastor&rsquo;s marriage and keep it strong as a model of Christ&rsquo;s  relationship with the Church. Pray that your pastor will tenderly cherish and  lead his wife and that she will respect and encourage her husband, submitting  to his leadership.(If your pastor is not married, pray for his relationships  with loved ones and those who are close to him.) (Eph. 5:23&ndash;33)</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that God will protect your pastor&rsquo;s wife from bitterness when her husband is  criticized.&nbsp; Pray that her prayer and  devotional life will be consistent, and that she will guard her mind and heart.  (Heb.12:15; Prov. 4:23) <b></b></p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> for your  pastor&rsquo;s children and especially that the pressures of the ministry will not  discourage or embitter them. Pray that your pastor will provide godly leader-ship in the home, not based on  fear of what others will think, but according to scriptural truth. (Eph. 6:4;  Col. 3:20-21) (If your pastor does not have children, pray that God will give  him many &ldquo;spiritual children&rdquo; as he shares the gospel.)</p>
              <p>Ask  God to protect your pastor from the evil plots of Satan. Pray that he will not  be corrupted as he rubs shoulders with the world in the course of  ministry.(John 17:15;Is. 54:17; 2 Cor. 2:11; 1 Pet.3:12;Ps. 9:9&ndash;10, 91:9&ndash;11)</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that God will build a hedge of protection around your pastor&rsquo;s marriage and  that he and his wife will be aware of the potential for any improper  relationships. Pray that their family time will be protected.(Ezek.22:30;2  Cor.10:4&ndash;5;Matt.19:6)</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that your pastor will  use discernment in use of email, the Internet, and other media. Ask God to  guard his heart concerning the use of free time. Pray that he will be morally  pure and that he will wear the armor of God so that he will not fall into  sexual temptation.(Rom.13:14;1 Pet.1:16; Eph. 6:10&ndash;18; 2 Cor. 10:4)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>that your pastor will be humble and authentic in his faith, not given to  pride or hypocrisy. Pray that he will have pure motives and give God glory for  every gain or victory.( Mic. 6:8; Gal.6:14; Jn.7:17&ndash;18;1Cor. 10:1&ndash;13)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>that your pastor will make wise lifestyle choi&shy;ces in order to protect his  health, especially in the areas of exercise, eating moderately, and getting  sufficient rest. Pray for times of relaxation and renewal to balance the stress  of ministry.(Rom.12:1&ndash;2;1Cor. 6:19&ndash;20, 9:27;James 3:1-2)</p>
              <p>Praise God for your pastor&rsquo;s  leadership and pray that he will make godly decisions. Pray that he will lead  with a shepherd&rsquo;s heart and that he will always speak the truth in love.(1  Kings 3:9; 1 Pet.5:2; Rom.12:6&ndash;8; Jer. 3:15)</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that your  pastor will be a man of prayer and worship and that he will lead by  example&mdash;teaching the congregation how to walk in a close relationship with the  Father.(1 Thess. 5:17; Acts 1:14; Matt.4:10; Mk 1:35; Luke 22:46)</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that your pastor will use wise time management and that he will seek God&rsquo;s  perspective for his schedule, guarding his time against unnecessary interruptions.(Eph.5:15&ndash;16;  Col. 4:5; Ps. 90:12; Jn. 9:4)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>for a fresh divine anointing on your pastor&rsquo;s ministry. Pray that God&rsquo;s  working will be powerfully evident both in his personal life and the spiritual  life of the congregation.(1 Cor. 9:27; 2 Tim.1:7; Rom.15:18&ndash;19)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>that your pastor will not give in to discouragement, but will deal with  inevitable criticism and conflict by committing himself into the hands of God,  who jud&shy;ges righteously. (1Peter 2:23)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>that your pastor will practice servant leadership, edifying the  congregation with wisdom and serving with God&rsquo;s agape love. (  Gal.5:13;Eph.6:7;Mark10:43&ndash;45;Jn.13:5&ndash;9; Phil. 2:3&ndash;4)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>that God will give your pastor a clear, biblical vision of what your church  can be and should be for His glory and that he will communicate that vision  clearly and confidently to the church.(Prov.29:18; Jn15:16,  17:17;2Tim.3:5;Mal.3:11)</p>
              <p><b>Pray</b> that your pastor will seek God for personal revival and revival in your church  and community. (2 Chron. 7:14; Ps 69:32)</p>
              <p><b>Pray </b>that your  pastor will be a man of faith and have a passionate love for God,not giving in  to worries, fears,or an uptight and anxious spirit (1Jn4:18;Prov. 3:5,6</p>
              <p>Ask  God to provide for the financial needs of your pastor and his family. Pray that  he will be a wise steward of finances and church funds. (Phil.4:19;Heb13:5)</p>
              <p>Ask  God to heal any hurts that your pastor has suffered in ministry. Pray that he  will serve the Lord with gladness (Isaiah 61:3).</p>
