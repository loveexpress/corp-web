            <h4 id="articleTitle">Youth in 2008</h4>
              <div id="authorname">by DeWayne Wright</div>
      <p >Today&rsquo;s generation is one of a kind, and ministering the gospel to them can be a challenge. I&rsquo;ve been the youth paster of Agape Family Worship Center&rsquo;s Agents of Change Youth Ministry in Rahway, New Jersey, under the awesome leadership of Senior Pastor Lawrence Powell, since 2002.</p>
      <p>I joined Agape in 2000, and by the next year I was serving as the youth ministry&rsquo;s director in a volunteer capacity. We only had 50 &ldquo;Agents of Change&rdquo; in 2001. Today, three years later, AOC has over 300 youth participating in the ministry, and I am on staff full-time. I was very happy to transition from volunteer to staff member, because I knew it was indicative of AOC&rsquo;s growth in numbers as well as the growing need to provide the teaching, programs and resources that the teens needed.</p>
      <p>There are many hardships in youth ministry. One of the hardest things to see is a young person do a total 180&deg;, only to return back to the world. You know what I&rsquo;m talking about if you&rsquo;ve been there even once &ndash; it can break your heart. The world is attractive to many of today&rsquo;s teenagers. The enemy is out to destroy them, and yet they welcome his seduction thinking it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to do. Myspace.com is drawing many young saints into a fantasy world. They live double or even triple lives already, being one way at church, another way at home, and even another way at school. Myspace.com is just another chance for them to hide from who they really are in Christ. The media compete for their attention and loyalty. It can all be intimidating, but only if you let it.</p>

      <p>I believe one of the main keys to being effective in youth ministry is learning to be led by the Spirit of God. He knows today&rsquo;s generation can reach them in ways our programs can&rsquo;t. throughout all the hardships I have faced, I have found sweet victory in seeing the fruit that remains in several of the youth that I serve. Even when it doesn&rsquo;t manifest before our eyes, we must remember that we meet everybody at a different place. We either sow seed for the first time, water the seed that another may have planted, or witness God bringing the increase!</p>
      <p>Another hardship I have faced is being able to balance ministry, school and home life. When I was single I could give all my free time to the youth. As a happily married man and full-time student, I face the challenge of learning to draw the line. Yet, youth ministry is my life. I enjoy what I do, and I serve a great leader. As youth specialists, we must develop a strong accountability to our senior pastors. When we have their blessings and support there is nothing we cannot do. Time management is crucial as well. We cannot have time to really build relationships and see youth ministry projects through if our schedules are out of whack.</p>
      <p>The last hardship I will focus on is the high turnover rate of youth leaders. Some youth leaders have not caught the vision of faithfulness to this generation. To the credit of the disgruntled youth leader, coming in they don&rsquo;t know the issues youth specialists face. Many times while we have the support of leadership, we don&rsquo;t have support from other church members or even from parents. The teens themselves can misbehave and may even seem ungrateful. then there are the budget constraints. We have to learn to improvise and do without, focusing on the youth ministry of our own churches without comparing our youth ministries to those elsewhere. Despite obstacles and challenges, we must be willing to be a big brother or sister &ndash; and often, a mother or father figure &ndash; to many of these youth, and we need longevity to be effective. We can&rsquo;t allow petty things or politics to steer us away from the kids who need us. By the way, youth are very intuitive. They look to see how we react to situations. Let&rsquo;s lead them in the right direction and show them patience and consistency in our own lives. God knows they need the consistency in theirs.</p>
      <p>The key to keeping everything in perspective, for me, is to focus on worship, not hardship. This is what I was created to do &ndash; to serve, love and protect these young people. We have been given the honor of preparing another generation. Do not lose heart, but let us grow in grace and keep doing what we do. Our legacy, an entire generation, depends on it.</p>
