            <p>Welcome to  the New Year of 2015. If we still find ourselves here in the land of the living  it must be because we have more yet to accomplish for the Kingdom. What has God  told you to do that you still have on the shelf? Today is the day that we begin  to go beyond what we usually do. Its time to step up our game! If not now, then  when? No matter the age or situation, now is the time for us to go full  throttle ahead.</p>
            <p>Where do we begin? In the beginning was  the WORD! So that's where we start or continue, in the Word of God, everyday.  Every year some of us resolve to read the Bible all the way through in a year.  Most of us know what usually happens by March or April or even earlier. But  this year maybe we should just commit to reading our Bible every single day,  and continue until we reach Revelation, no matter how long it takes. Next, I suggest we re-commit to spending time  with the Lord in prayer, a&nbsp; priority. If  we can set our hearts and minds to do more of these two things, our year will  be off to a solid start. Prayer and the Bible is our necessary food. Let's not  just say it, think it, wish it, let's just do it!</p>
            <p>With a strong consistent start we can go forward in the things God has  called us to do individually and collectively.  We are called to spread the Good News of the gospel and win the lost.  Here's a painful question for some of us:&quot;When is the last time you gave  out a tract?? Way back in the early 80's an unsaved friend gave me a Chic comic  book type tract entitled &quot;This is your Life.&quot; Two weeks later my next  door neighbor back visiting from California lead me back to the Lord. I was a  sometime church goer and an all the time party goer. Salvation became real. I  re-dedicated my life back to the Lord, got born again and fill with the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues, all  in the same day. Quite amazing especial&shy;ly since I was brought up in a  denomination I'll refer to affectionately as the &quot;frozen chosen&quot;,  LOL! I still believe that the right tract serves a tremendous purpose. The word  will not return void. But we have to sow it and tracts have not gone out of  style.</p>
            <p>Take a look at the field all around us.  Let us commit to being intentional this year. Sharing the gospel on our block,  in the building we live in. Do our neighbors and co-workers know that we are  believers in Jesus Christ. If not, why not. Let's get busy and Step Up Our  Game! It starts with a simple &quot;Hello,&quot; to all the people around us  especially the young people, many of which are un&shy;churched. They often don't  expect adults to say a pleasant &quot;hello&quot; to them. I encourage you to  try it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised and possibly learn something as well. A warm greeting is the  beginning of showing the unconditional love of Christ. If you really decide to  be intentional, God will show you just what to do and when to do it. I've  experienced some memorable times out of the confines of my comfort zone.</p>
            <p> Some of our younger generation  may seem challenging but Jesus said &quot;suffer the children to come unto me.&quot; Remember the song we sung in Sunday  school? &quot;Jesus loves the little children; red and yellow, black and white  all are precious in His sight&quot;. &quot;Hello and Jesus loves you&quot; are  seeds that will reap a mighty harvest. Prayer will  condition the soil of their hearts and change your hesitation to wisdom with  boldness. Faith comes by hearing and  practice makes perfect as we put legs to our prayers as doers of the worK. Paul  said: I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 1Cor.3:6 KJ  V.</p>
