              <span class="qa">Youth Ministry </span></h4>
            <div id="authorname">

            <p class="qa">The Shift &ndash; From Event Driven To Discipleship</p>
            <p>A shift has taken place over the years throughout Christianity and specifically in the NY Metro Region in youth ministries from event based ministry to ongoing discipleship and lifestyle of following Christ. I see youth ministries digging into life&rsquo;s issues and being real with teens the way Jesus was. We may talk about big events but the most meaningful youth ministry happens on a daily and weekly basis through men and wo&shy;men who just take the time to walk with teens and do life with them.</p>
            <p class="qa">The Shift &ndash; Long Term Youth Leaders</p>
            <p>Youth Ministry can be very challenging as we deal with individuals and a group of teens that are going through some of life&rsquo;s greatest challenges while being hormonally driven and transitioning through high school and college. But one of the great things that I see is Youth Leaders who are focused on youth&ndash;period. They are there to walk with teens through these times and I see more and more youth leaders who are building year after year.</p>
            <p>There is also a group of Youth Pastors who have been serving in our region for over 10 years who have been passionately pouring into the lives of youth leaders from many different churches and denominations and providing vision and maturity to our region.</p>
            <p class="qa">Reaching this youth generation is a TEAM EFFORT!</p>
            <p>We must continue to work together as churches and ministries to reach the young generation. Statistics say that 90% of those who come to Christ do so by their early 20s. Statistics also say that up to 70% of teens graduate from God after they graduate from high school. We must reach more, but even more importantly we must disciple more!</p>
            <p class="qa"><strong>FUEL 2011<br />
  October 7th&ndash;9th, 2011</strong></p>
            <p>Pastor Jacob Burgei has a passion to help build a culture where teens stay FUELED up with the things of God and live out a life that honors God. He was tired of seeing teens get excited for a few weeks and watch that fire slowly fade and go out. To keep a fire going, you have to add fuel. The FUEL Conference&ndash; <a href="http://www.fuelconf.com">www.fuelconf.com</a> &ndash; will be a three day discipleship event designed to train teens how to follow Jesus on a daily basis and learn how to live a life of continual growth and elevation in their relationship with Jesus instead of living and up and down walk with no real fruit to show. Worship, arts and leadership training will also be highlights of FUEL!</p>
            <p class="qa">God Belongs In My City &ndash; NY Prayer Walk &ndash; Saturday Oct. 29th, 2011</p>
            <p>God Belongs In My City (GBIMC)&ndash;began with 4 youth leaders in Brooklyn, NY in response to an atheist campaign that spent $25,000 to promote the belief of &ldquo;no God&rdquo; throughout NY City. In 12 days, 1500 teens and concerned adults joined together on Nov. 14th, 2009 to declare that &ldquo;God Belongs In My City&rdquo; in NY. To take part in this year&rsquo;s walk or to learn more go to <a href="http://www.Godbelongsinmycity.com">www.Godbelongsinmycity.com</a>. The God Belongs In My City book has also just been released which chronicles the birth and growth of GBIMC but more importantly, is a powerful discipleship tool to teach our youth and leaders the importance of prayer and how individual teens and adults can change their city through personal and group prayers.</p>
            <p class="qa">Mission 10:20 &ndash; Training 10,000 Leaders to Win 1 Million Souls by 2020</p>
            <p>As part of our ongoing commitment to building local leaders to lead strong youth ministries, there are ongoing youth leader trainings through NJ and NY. Please go to <a href="http://www.4thgen.org">www.4thgen.org</a> to get connected to some of these. God gave me a vision in 2009 to train 10,000 leaders who will commit to win 10 teens a year to the Lord by 2020. If 10,000 leaders win 10 teens a year for 10 years, that equals 1 million teens by 2020. We are also organizing groups of youth ministries to work together by region. Let us know if you want to be a part of a coalition.</p>
            <p class="qa">Strong Youth Ministries Who Work Together</p>
            <p>Our goals are simple. Let&rsquo;s build a strong youth ministry in EVERY church. Let&rsquo;s build coalitions and networks of youth ministries that partner and work together in their town, city or region. Let&rsquo;s connect these coalitions and networks together a couple of times a year for major events like God Belongs In My City, BATTLECRY, FUEL and others.</p>
            <p class="qa">Every Youth Leader and Teen Being Powerfully Used</p>
            <p>Articles like these usually highlight a couple of events happening in the Body of Christ but the reality is the most important ministry takes place in the local church and our neighborhoods on a daily basis. Our goal is that we help provide the training and community to help local youth leaders and teens to do mighty exploits where they live, work and play each day!</p>
