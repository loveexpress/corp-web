              <p>With a few  exceptions, all churches were small at one time. They began with a handful of  people and went forward from there. Some grew a great deal and are still  expanding, some grew a little and leveled off, while some failed to grow at  all.</p>
              <p>If most of the churches in America of  all denominations are small -- and in my mind, that means 100 or less in  attendance -- then several things are true:</p>
              <p>&bull; In the words of Lincoln about common  folk,&ldquo;God must have loved them; He made so many of them.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&bull; Small churches must be doing something right or people would not  keep attending them.</p>
              <p>&bull; The &ldquo;bigness  culture&rdquo; that is so dominant in American life has dumped a burdensome  load of guilt on these small congregations. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so good, why aren&rsquo;t you  big?&rdquo; seems to be the mantra.</p>
              <p>&bull; For every book celebrating the small church,  there are a hundred telling them how to leave smallness behind and become  &ldquo;great.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Someone should put in a good word for  small chur&shy;ches. Think I&rsquo;ll give it a try.</p>
              <p>Here are my observations on small  churches in America.</p>
              <p><strong>1) Size  does matter</strong></p>
              <p>Although we sometimes say that the size  of a church is irrelevant, that&rsquo;s not exactly right. Francis Schaeffer said  there are no small churches and no big pastors. That&rsquo;s almost right, too, but not totally.</p>
              <p>The numbers of people who participate in  a church will usually dictate the income it  receives and therefore the ministries it is  able to do. Size matters.</p>
              <p>The church that wants to send its  members on missions to Haiti or Belize or Ukraine will need money. It takes  members to contribute the money. A small congregation can come up with the  resources to fund such excursions, but it&rsquo;s harder.</p>
              <p>The church that wants to have a  full-time pastor living on the field will need mo&shy;ney for his support. The mem&shy;bers  are the ones expected to give that money. A small congregation will almost  always have less mo&shy;ney.</p>
              <p>Size is important.</p>
              <p><strong>2) But  size does not have to be determinative</strong></p>
              <p>The small church can do everything it  needs to do and everything the Lord wants it to do. God is its Resource, and  His supplies are inexhaustible.</p>
              <p>The greatest small church is one where  the lea&shy;ders and members never ask, &ldquo;What  can we afford?&rdquo; but &ldquo;What does the Lord want us to do?&rdquo; Such chur&shy;ches are visionaries.</p>
              <p>If the Lord wants a congregation of  fifty members to send a delegation to Haiti to help with the rebuilding of  lives, a &ldquo;great small church&rdquo; will find ways to do it. My opinion is the  absolute worst way to fund such projects is for the church to set up a ta&shy;ble  at the entrance of the lo&shy;cal supermarket and ask the public for contributions.  That makes the church a charity, not a ministry. Good people will often give a  contribution--I try to do so myself--but they will  do it warily, unsure of whether the mo&shy;ney will make it to the designated  project.</p>
              <p>Better for the members to get under the  burden of funding the work. Call the members together, prayerful&shy;ly set the  goal, and ask each one to commit to reaching it.</p>
              <p>The fellowship and camaraderie of  working toge&shy;ther to achieve a big goal will far outstrip the joy of collecting  the money at the supermarket on Saturday. The sense of accomplishment once the  mission team returns can be life-changing to a small church.</p>
              <p>Small churches can do anything the Lord wants them to do. The first  congregation assigned to reach the world with the gospel of Jesus was no more  than 120 strong. And yet, look what they did.</p>
              <p><strong>3) It&rsquo;s  easier to get things done in a small church</strong></p>
              <p>A church running 50 in attendance will  have a part-time pastor and maybe 3 deacons.  If a decision needs to be made today, the four of them can meet in the  hallway between Sunday School and  Church. All the leaders of that church combined will not number more than a do&shy;zen.  Such a small group can meet easily and quickly and do their business  efficiently.</p>
              <p>The larger the organization, the longer  it takes to start it up, turn it around, or bring it to a halt.</p>
              <p>A leader once  said of our denomination, &ldquo;It takes a full generation to say  &lsquo;hel&shy;lo&rsquo; to Southern Baptists.&rdquo; He was referring to the time required for a  communication to filter down through the va&shy;ri&shy;ous  layers of denominatio&shy;nal bureaucracy and to penetrate every  congregation.</p>
              <p>If the pastor of a large church requires  six years to &ldquo;become&rdquo; the leader in the fullest sense of the word--that&rsquo;s a  figure I&rsquo;ve heard for years--then, it takes a  lot less time for the shepherd of a small congregation. The pastor of  fifty people can learn their names quickly. He can phone every home in an hour or two. In a small community, he sees  his members every time he runs to the store or eats in a restaurant.</p>
              <p>When the small church votes to begin a  ministry or buy a piano or bring in a new staffer, the members fully expect to  see something happening the next time they meet. They voted it, the person  responsible got the message, it should be happening. There are few complications to  making things happen that they all agree on.</p>
              <p><strong>4) A  small church gives personal attention</strong></p>
              <p>Someone reading this will remember his  name. A few months after Katrina wrought its deadly work on our part of the  world, Billy and Franklin Graham held a weekend meeting in the New Orleans Arena. Each service was preceded by a colleague of  theirs who play&shy;ed what was billed as  &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s fastest guitar.&rdquo; He played, sang a little, and shared his  testimo&shy;ny. I will not forget one thing the man said.</p>
              <p>He grew up in a small church. The church  was so tiny, he and his brother were the entire youth department. Their pastor was 75 years old.</p>
              <p>I was stunned.</p>
              <p>I wondered what would happen if we could  go back to that church, perhaps 30 years  earlier, and inform them that one of their members would become a great  talent and a world-renown witness for Christ.  Would they believe it? Or would they take  the dodge of so many small chur&shy;ches  everywhere, that, &ldquo;No&shy;thing important will  ever come out of our small church&rdquo;?</p>
              <p>The fact that this youth came from that  church tells us they did something right.</p>
              <p>Over the decades, I&rsquo;ve spoken to college  groups on many campuses. Always, before  the speaker rises, the students will lead the  service. They handle the welcome, pray the prayers, make introductions, and sing. My observation is that  the most gifted of these young people grew up, not in mega-churches where the youth group numbered in the hundreds,  but in small chur&shy;ches where they were encouraged to take a lead.</p>
              <p><strong>5) A  small church puts everyone to work</strong></p>
              <p>The larger the organization of any kind,  the smal&shy;ler the percentage that will handle the actual work. In a small  church, everyone is needed to work and, if it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;great small church,&rdquo;  everyone is put to work.</p>
              <p>A small church uses volunteers  everywhere--in the office, cleaning the buildings, mowing the lawn, teaching children, leading choirs, playing the piano.  A small church will not hire a painting contractor to refurbish the buildings;  it will have a &ldquo;work day&rdquo; and the members will do it all on a Saturday.</p>
              <p>A small church, one that does it right,  will come closer than most to fulfilling  Romans 12:3-8 where each member uses his/her spiritual gifts to do the  work God gives to them.</p>
              <p><strong>6) A  small church can excell at fellowship</strong></p>
              <p>My personal prescription for Christian  fellowship is: each member of the church loves the Lord, like each other, and  welcomes the newcomer to their midst. When they work together, they have fun  doing it.</p>
              <p>If a newcomer feels inti&shy;midated on  walking into a huge religious edifice, he will feel more comfortable entering a  small, humbler church building. A small church can take advantage of this.</p>
              <p>Instead of bemoaning the absence of stained glass windows and pipe organs and vaulted ceilings, the  members of a small church will recognize that those can be negatives to  an un&shy;church&shy;ed fellow entering for the first time. He is far more likely to  feel at home in New Home Church No. 2 than the First-Metro Church.</p>
              <p>The danger with small churches, of  course, is that they will have great fellowship within their own membership but  freeze out the newcomer. The members have known each other for so long, they  may function more like a large Sunday School class than a Church of the Lord  Jesus Christ.</p>
              <p>At the invitation of the pastor, I was  visiting Bridge&shy;ton Baptist Church a few miles from my house. The church sits  in a lovely middle-class neighborhood but has not grown in years. The pastor  was trying to find the key to bringing in new people. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;this church is going to die within one generation.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The forty or fifty members seemed to  average 60 in age. That morning, I met several of them and enjoyed their  fellowship.</p>
              <p>Later, I told the pastor, &ldquo;What your  people see as its problem, you should turn to an advantage.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>The problem, most of them felt, was the  age of the members. In churches and denominations all across this land, if a  church is not filled with crowds of young adults and children, they&rsquo;re made to  feel they are doomed.</p>
              <p>I said, &ldquo;Pastor, if I were a young  father looking for a church for my family, I would bring them to Bridgeton  Church. Think of all the grandparents and  uncles and aunts my children would have. Your people would smother them  with love.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>That was a new idea to him, one he liked so much he shared it with  the church and used it as the theme of their outreach in the community.</p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s not  necessary to state the obvious here, that the typical young  family is looking for a large church with a variety of ministries and opportunities  for their children. I think many of them are making a mistake.</p>
              <p>I&rsquo;m the  product of a small church--and a large one too, come to think of  it.</p>
              <p>The small church provi&shy;ded the nurturing  environment for our family during my childhood. I came to know the Lord in the  small church. I was taught the Bi&shy;ble and knew I was loved there.</p>
              <p>The large church--I joined it during college--thrust me into the  middle of a great group of excited Christian young people where I could grow.  It gave me a vision for the world. In my second year in that congregation, the Lord called me into the ministry.</p>
              <p>There are small large churches--made up  of hundreds of members but lacking vision, fellowship, and heart.</p>
              <p>There are great small churches--with  small numbers but excellent vision, warm fellowship, and a great soul. Let&rsquo;s  hear it for the small church.</p>
