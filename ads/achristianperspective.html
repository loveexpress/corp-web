            <h4 id="articleTitle">A Christian Perspective of Our Nation's Racial Tension.</h4>
              <div id="authorname">By Sherri Sharpe
<!--SECTION LEFT END--></div>
              
              <p>When I was  a young teen perhaps thirteen years old or so, my Father God blessed me to be  the one chosen to deliver the message for our <em>&ldquo;Youth Day&rdquo;</em> at <em>Mt. Lebanon  Baptist Church</em> in Peekskill, New York. I recall it was a very volatile time  in our then small town, located in the beautiful Hudson River Valley of upper  New York State. The turmoil arose from racial tension that stemmed from a  shooting which had recently taken place in a local bar.</p>
              <p>During that time (the mid-sixties),  murders were a rare occurrence in our town. So when a young African-American  teen by the name of Wayne Buffalo had been shot by a White man (whose name I do  not recall), the news spread rapidly and became the &ldquo;talk of the town.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>It was in this kind of climate of  brewing unrest, hatred, and racial strife, that God gave me, a young teen&shy;ager,  a platform from which to express my views concerning this crisis. I now  understand why my Father gave me this opportunity from which to speak at such a  significant time. It was because He knew that I would speak forth the words  that He put in my heart and mind to speak. He knew that although I was still  practically a child, I would speak forth the words of wisdom and virtue that He  gave me to express to His dear people in our local church.</p>
              <p>....So I did; when I sat down to write  out my sermon, God flooded my heart with&#8200;His insights and His  perspective. As I wrote down these ideas, somehow I knew in my heart that I was  writing God&rsquo;s will and God&rsquo;s viewpoint of all the confusion and turmoil that  was transpiring in our city.</p>
              <p>So on <em>&ldquo;Youth Sunday&rdquo;</em> when I stood up to deliver my message; this is the  basic theme of what God had put in my heart to communicate. <em>I said that we as a race of people should  not resort to hate because of the murder that took place. I said that it was  wrong for us to blame the entire white race for the act of one individual. I  reminded the people in my congregation that it was not an entire race of people  that pulled the trigger that killed Wayne Buffalo, but that it was only one man  that committed this terrible crime!</em></p>
              <p>Now beloved, although several decades  have pass&shy;ed since I preached my very first sermon as a youth, we find  ourselves once again reliving the same racial tension in our nation that many  of us recall from the 1960s&rsquo;. Once again my Father has given me a message to  share with His people straight from His heart. The only difference is that now,  as a born-again disciple of Jesus, and a Minister of the Gospel, the message my  Father has given me is taken directly from His holy written Word.</p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;Be  submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the Lord,  whether it be to the emperor as supreme or to governors as sent by him to bring  vengeance (punishment, justice) to those who do wrong and to encourage those  who do good service.</em></p>
              <p><em>For  it is God&rsquo;s will and intention that by doing right (your good and honest lives)  should silence (muzzle, gag) the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticisms  of foolish persons.</em></p>
              <p><em>[Live]  as free people, [yet] without employing your freedom as a pretext for wic&shy;kedness, but [live at all times] as servants  of God.</em></p>
              <p><em>Show respect for <strong>all  men</strong></em><em>(Emphasis mine)  [treat them honorably]. Love the brotherhood (the Christian fraternity of which  Christ is the Head.) Reverence God. Honor the emperor.</em></p>
              <p><em>[You who are] household </em><em>servants, be submissive to your masters with  all [pro&shy;per] respect, not only to those who are kind and considerate and  reasonable, but also to those who are surely  (overbearing, <strong>unjust</strong>, and <strong>croo&shy;ked</strong>.) (Emphasis mine)</em></p>
              <p><em>For  one is regarded favorably (is approved, acceptable, and thankworthy) if, as in  the sight of God, he <strong>endures</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>pain</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>unjust</strong>] suffering. (Emphasis mine)</em></p>
              <p><em>[After  all] what kind of glory [is there in it] if, when you do wrong and are punished  for it, you take it patiently? But if you [bear patiently] with suffering [which results] <strong>when you do right and that is undeserved, it is acceptable and pleasing  to God. For even to this were you called [it is inse&shy;parable from yourvocation]. For Christ also suffered for you,  leaving for you [His personal] example, so that you should follow in His  footsteps.</strong></em></p>
              <p>(Emphasis  mine) 1 Peter 2:13-21 (Amplified Version)</p>
              <p>To help put these ver&shy;ses into our  current context, please re-read this same passage with the following  substitutions: (1) Replace &ldquo;emperor&rdquo; with President; (2) Replace &ldquo;governors&rdquo;  with policeman and women; (3) Replace &ldquo;household servants&rdquo; with employees; (4)  Replace &ldquo;masters&rdquo; with employers, managers, and supervisors.</p>
              <p>I realize beloved that what God is  exhorting us to do in these verses is not politically correct, popular, or even  easy to obey. However, as believers in and followers of Jesus, we do not have  the luxury of picking and choosing which Scriptures we&rsquo;re going to obey. If we  are genuine, committed disciples of Jesus, then we will be willing to <em>submit</em> our own ideas, wills, opinions, emotions, and attitudes to  God&rsquo;s way of conduct and lifestyle for us which are clearly outlined in the  Bible!</p>
              <p>We are called to live according to a  much higher standard than the world. And those of us in the Body who are in  positions of leadership, whether apostles, pro&shy;phets, evangelists, pastors, or  teachers, are called to an even higher standard than the laity of the Church!  (See James 3:1)</p>
              <p>Therefore, the prevailing question for  Christians today is, <em>&ldquo;How are we to  respond to the racial tension and turmoil taking place in our nation today?&rdquo;</em> The answer is simple. We are to be the &ldquo;light of the world&rdquo; and the &ldquo;salt of  the earth.&rdquo; However, we cannot be salt and light apart from the Word of God.  Remember, the Word is a <em>&ldquo;lamp to our feet  and a light to our path.&rdquo;</em> First and foremost we are called to <strong>pray</strong>. However, after we pray, we must seek out  God&rsquo;s wisdom found in the Scriptures so that we will not become guilty of  following the evil ways of the world.  Concerning racial tension, we are not to take the side of either the  Blacks or the Whites. We as Christians are to take the side of <strong>RIGHTEOUSNESS</strong> and <strong>TRUTH</strong> found only in the written Word of God! We must show respect  and honor to <em>all</em> men, especially  those in positions of authority. We are not to hate or criticize White  policemen or politicians we disagree with or disapprove of. We are to show  respect to all leaders whether civic, state, or national, and teach our  children to do the same. Our respect for authority is not based on their level  of integrity and, or justice. The Bible clearly states in the above passage  that we are to honor <em>all</em> men, whether  they are just or unjust; and that if we suffer unjustly, then God will honor  and bless us!</p>
              <p>On a recent Christian talk radio  program, a gentleman called in who referred to himself as Bishop.  During his discourse with the talk show host, who is a fellow Christian, he  accused the host of being influenced by the KKK,&rdquo; simply because the host was  saying that as Christians we should be willing to wait to hear all the facts,  before passing judgment on the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri!</p>
              <p>Our Bishop brother did not realize that  he was of the <em>wrong spirit</em>! And so  many others of our precious brothers and sisters in Christ have adopted the  wrong worldly spirit of hatred and prejudice against White policemen or even  against White people in general. This is wrong for it is allowing their  emotions to be manipulated by Satan, who is the spirit of strife and division!</p>
              <p>We do not have to condone or agree with  all the darkness and evil going on around us. However, God has called us to be  the <em>solution</em> to the world&rsquo;s problems;  we are not to become a part of the problem! </p>
              <p>In conclusion beloved brethren, Jesus  has warned us that in these &ldquo;last days&rdquo; (which we are obviously in now), there  would be perilous times. We are in these times right now. But remember, as the  world grows dar&shy;ker and darker, the Church of Jesus Christ should be growing brighter and brigh&shy;ter. However, the Church  will only increase in as each one of us <em>individual </em>members allows our individual &ldquo;light to shine!&rdquo;</p>
              <p>In my recent Sunday School class, each  child had to share one way they were going to let their &ldquo;light shine&rdquo; for  Jesus. I&rsquo;m asking you be&shy;loved to do the same thing. Please prayerfully  consider at least one way you too can &ldquo;let your light shine more brightly for  Jesus&rdquo; in this world of darkness, confusion, and  turmoil.</p>
              <p>Lastly, my challenge to you is to RESIST  the temptation to take sides with the world; don&rsquo;t be ruled by your emotions.  Instead commit yourself to daily prayer, Bible study and drawing closer to God  than you&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
              <p>You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how God will then  begin to use you as a &ldquo;voice&rdquo; to speak forth  His truth and wisdom, and His &ldquo;Good News&rdquo; to this lost and dying world!</p>
