              <p>It seems  almost every day a client asks me questions about organic foods: should I only  eat organic foods? Is non-organic food dangerous? What if I can&rsquo;t afford  organic food, should I just not buy any fruits and vegetables? There is a lot  of confusing information in the media about organic foods, and at times, a lot  of it is just hype. So to help my clients make informed buying decisions, I  created a Q&amp;A Organic Foods Fact Sheet.  This month, I&rsquo;m sharing some of these facts with you. I hope they  empower you to choose wisely, and possibly save some money in the process. </p>
              <p> <strong>What does &lsquo;organic&rsquo; really mean?</strong> Organic is a term used to indicate foods or other agricultural  products that have been produced through approved methods that incorporate  cultural, biological, and mechanical practices  that promote cycling of resources, ecological  balance and biodiversity conservation. It does not allow the use of  synthetic fertilizers, sew&shy;age sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering.  Simply, organic farming is a commitment to sustainable farming methods that do not harm the environment.</p>
              <p> <strong>How  do you know a product is organic?</strong> This is where label reading is really  important! Products that are made completely from orga&shy;nic ingredients can be  labeled as &lsquo;100% organic&rsquo;. Products that are made from 95% organic ingredients  can be labeled as &lsquo;organic&rsquo;. Products  made with at least 70% organic ingredients can be labeled as &lsquo;made with organic  ingredients.&rsquo; These are critical distinctions, as a lot of products tout their  inclusion of organic ingredients, but it is the non-organic ingredients that  may be a cause for concern.</p>
              <p> <strong>Is  organic the same as natural?</strong> Although used interchangeably, the terms  &lsquo;organic&rsquo; and &lsquo;natural&rsquo; are not synonymous.  Only foods and products that are grown and processed according to Uni&shy;ted  States Department of Agriculture (USDA) standards  can be labeled organic. To ensure what you are buying is organic, look  for the USDA organic label.</p>
              <p> <strong>Is  organic healthier than conventionally grown foods?</strong> In terms of nutrition  content, there is no significant difference. This is a critical point if  purchasing organic foods would create a strain on your budget. In this case,  the priority should be ensuring that you and your family are eating sufficient  fruits and vegetables daily. Now, as it relates to the amount of synthetic  ingredients and chemicals used in growing food products, organic foods are  superior to conventionally grown foods. They have been shown to have less of an  impact on our environment and contain fewer additives, hormones and pesticides.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean you should avoid all non-organic foods. Although chronic  ingestion of large do&shy;ses of these chemicals have been linked to greater risk  of asthmatic and allergy-related disorders,  the amount used in conventional foods is far below the danger threshold.  However, for those individuals with allergies, or diagnosed sensitivity to  certain chemicals, organic foods may be  a safe option, and allow for greater food variety. </p>
              <p><strong>Is  it necessary to eat ALL organic?</strong> Again, it depends on your  personal beliefs, and your budget. If you need to choose, here are some  guidelines: any produce that requires peeling does not need to be organic.  However, there are some exceptions. To make it easy, here are the &lsquo;Clean  Fifteen&rsquo; &ndash; those foods you don&rsquo;t have to buy organic: avocadoes, sweet corn,  pineapples, cabbage, sweet peas frozen, onions, asparagus, mangos, papayas,  kiwi, eggplant, grapefruit, cantaloupe, cauliflower and sweet potatoes. </p>
              <p>If you are going to buy organic, splurge  on those with permeable or edible skin, such as the &lsquo;Dirty Do&shy;zen&rsquo;: apples,  peaches, nectarines, strawberries, grapes, celery,  spinach, sweet bell peppers, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, snap peas, and white  potatoes.</p>
              <p>For a more comprehensive list on what to  buy organic, visit the Environmental Working  Group&rsquo;s website at www.ewg.org.</p>
              <p> <strong>How  about produce washes? Can they help reduce my exposure to pesticides and other  chemi- cals?</strong> As magical as these cleaning  products may sound, studies show that these pro&shy;ducts do not remove  pesticides and other chemicals, as these are mostly inside the food. Rinsing  your produce with tap water is just as good. </p>
              <p>It is important to be informed about the  foods you put in your body. Don&rsquo;t believe everything you hear in the media. We  have to be alert and discerning, as this is God&rsquo;s will. Test everything that is  said. Hold on to what is good (1 Thessalonians 5: 21).</p>
