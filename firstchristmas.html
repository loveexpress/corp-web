              <div></div>
              <p>Once  upon a time in the land of Judah, there was a man named Isaiah.</p>
              <p>One  day he saw a vi&shy;sion concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah,  Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He said that the Lord himself shall  give a sign:</p>
              <div id="articlepic"><img src="images/xbaby.gif" alt="" width="128" height="95" id="authorpic" /> </div>
              <p><em>&quot;Behold, a virgin shall  conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. For unto us a child  is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder:  and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The  everlasting Fa&shy;ther, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and  peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to  order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth  even for ever.&quot;</em> </p>
              <p>This  is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: In the city of Galilee, there was  a small town named Nazareth. There lived a girl called Mary who was pro&shy;mised  in marriage to a des&shy;cendant of King David named Joseph.</p>
              <div id="articlepic"><img src="images/xfamily.gif" alt="" width="137" height="106" id="authorpic" /> </div>
              <p>Later,  angel Gabriel was sent by God to speak to Mary, <em>&quot;Mary, God has been gracious to you. You will become pregnant and  give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be  called the Son of the Most High God. God will make him a king, as the king of  the descendants of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end!&quot;</em></p>
              <p>Mary  said to the angel, &quot;I am a virgin. How, then, can this be?&quot;</p>
              <p>The  angel answered, <em>&quot;The Holy Spirit  will come on you, and God's power will rest upon you. For this reason the holy  child will be called the son of God. There is not a thing that God cannot  do.&quot;</em></p>
              <p>&quot;I  am the Lord's servant,&quot; said Mary; &quot;may it happen to me as you have  said.&quot; And the angel left her.</p>
              <p>Then  Joseph her es&shy;poused husband, being a just man, and not willing to disgrace  Ma&shy;ry publicly, was minded to break the en&shy;gage&shy;ment se&shy;cretly. But while he  was thinking about this, an an&shy;gel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,  saying,</p>
              <p><em>&quot;Joseph, descendant of  David, do not fear to take Mary to be your wife. For it is by the Holy Spirit  that she has conceived. She will give birth to a son, and you will name him  JESUS: for he will save his people from their sins.&quot;</em></p>
              <p>Now  all this happened in order to fulfilled what the Lord had said through the  prophet,<em>&quot;The virgin will become  pregnant and give birth to a son, and he will be called <strong>Emmanuel</strong>, which means God is with us.&quot;</em></p>
              <p>So  when Joseph woke up he did what the angel had told him and married Mary.</p>
              <p>At  that time Emperor Augustus sent out an order for all the citizens of the Empire  to register themselves for the census. Eve&shy;ryone, then went to register  himself, each to his own town.</p>
              <p>Joseph  went from the town of Nazareth, in Gali&shy;lee, to Judea, to the town named  Bethlehem, where King David was born.</p>
              <p>Joseph  went there be&shy;cause he was a descendant of David. He went to register himself  with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him. She was pregnant, and while  they were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to give birth.</p>
              <p>As  there were so many people going back to their hometown for registration, Joseph  and Mary could find no room for them in the inn. Then they came to a manger  where Mary gave birth to her first son, Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic2"><img src="images/xshepard.gif" alt="shepherd" width="40" height="69" id="authorpic2" /> </div>
              <p>And  in the same country there were shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch  over their flock by night. An angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory  of the Lord shone round about them. They were terribly afraid, but the angel  said to them, <em>&quot;Fear not: for,  behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ  the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in  swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.&quot;</em> And suddenly there was with the  angel a multitude of the heavenly host singing praises to God, <strong><em>&quot;Glory  to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.&quot;</em></strong></p>
              <p>When  the angels went away from them back into heaven, the shepherds said to one  another, &quot;Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened,  that the Lord has told us.&quot;</p>
              <p>So  they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and saw the baby lying in the  manager. When the shepherds saw him they told them what the angel had said  about this child. All who heard it were filled with wonder at what the  shepherds told them. Mary remembered all these things and thought deeply about  them.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>The  shepherds went back, singing praises to God for all they had heard and seen; it  had just as the angel had told them. </p>
              <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic"><img src="images/xsearch.gif" alt="wise men" width="277" height="209" id="authorpic3" /> </div>
              <p>Now  when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, there came  wise men from the east to Je&shy;ru&shy;salem, saying, &quot;Where is the baby born to  be the king of the Jews? For we saw his star came up in the east, and we have  come to worship him.&quot;</p>
              <p>When  King Herod heard about these he was very troubled, and so was everyone else in  Jerusalem. He called together all the chief priests and the teachers of the Law  and asked them,: Where will the Mes&shy;siah be born?&quot; &quot;In the town of  Bethlehem, in Judea,&quot; they answered. &quot;This is what the prophet wrote: <em>&quot;And thou Bethlehem, in the land of  Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a  Governor, that shall rule my people Is&shy;ra&shy;el.&quot;</em></p>
              <p>Then  Herod called the wise men secretly and found out from them the exact time the  star ap&shy;peared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, <em>&quot;Go and search carefully for the young child; and when you find  him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.&quot;</em> </p>
              <p>Then  they departed and on their way they saw the star--the same one they had seen in  the east--and it went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place  where the child was.</p>
              <p>When  they saw the star, they rejoiced with ex&shy;ceeding great joy. And when they went  into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mo&shy;ther. They knelt down  and worshipped him; then they opened their bags of treasures, offered him  gifts: gold, myrrh and frankincense.</p>
              <p>God  warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod; so they went back to their  country by another road.</p>
