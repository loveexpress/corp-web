              <p class="qa">Festival of the Dead</p>
              <p>The origins and traditions of  Halloween can be traced back thousands of years to the days of the ancient  Celts and their priests, the Druids. The eve of October 31 marked the  transition from summer into the darkness of winter. It marked the Celtic New  Year. The Feast of Samhain was a fearsome night, a dreaded night, a night in  which great bonfires were lit to Samana the Lord of Death, the dark Aryan god  who was known as the Grim Reaper, the lea&shy;der of the ancestral ghosts.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>On  this night the spirits of the dead rose up, shivering with the coming cold of  winter and seeking the warmth and the affection of the homes they once inhabited.&nbsp; Even the colder darker creatures filled the  night: evil witches, flying through the night, hobgoblins, and evil pookas that  appeared in the form of hideous black hor&shy;ses. Demons, fairies and&nbsp; ghouls roamed about as the doors of the  burial sidh-mounds opened wide, allowing them free access to the world of the  living men. These loathsome beings were usually not in a&nbsp; particularly good mood by the time they  arrived and it was feared that unless these spirits were appeased and soothed  with offerings and gifts they would wreak mischief and ven&shy;geance by destroying  crops, killing cattle, turning milk sour, and generally making life miserable.</p>
              <p>So  it was that families offered what was most precious to them: food-a &ldquo;treat&rdquo;  which the ghostly blackmailers might otherwise be tempted to inflict. </p>
              <p>The  ancient Celtic villa&shy;gers realized, however, that merely feeding the spirits  might not be enough to speed them on their way.&nbsp;  The ghoulies might decide it would be rude to eat and run, as it were,  and might just be tempted to stick around. That simply would not do. So arose  the practice of dressing in masks and costumes: chosen villagers disguised  themselves as the fall creatures at large, mystically taking on their  attributes and powers. The &ldquo;mummers&rdquo; as they were called, cavorted from house  to house collecting the ancient celtic equivalent of protection mo&shy;ney, and  then&nbsp; romped the ghosts right out of town  when they were through. </p>
              <p>They  carried a jack-o-lantern to light there way-a turnip or potato with a fearful demonic  face carved into it which they hoped would duly impress, if not intimidate, the  demons around them.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="qa">Spirited Communion</p>
              <p>Modern  witches would vehemently deny that their celebration has anything to do with  the demonic horrors depicted in such films as Friday the 13th. To them  Halloween is the time of harvest celebration- that season in which the great  goddess goes to sleep for the long winter months, giving way to the horned god  of hunting and death, who will rule until her return on the first of May. It is  a time of ritual and for ridding oneself of personal weakness, a time for  feasting and joyful celebration. It is also a time for communing with the  spirits of the dead.&nbsp; </p>
              <p class="qa">Imitators of God</p>
              <p>So...should  your family participate in the traditional Halloween celebrations?  Absolutely...if you and/or your children are Witches, Sata&shy;nists, Humanists,  atheists, or anything other than born-again Christians (or Orthodox Jews). For  a true christian to participate in the ancient trappings of Halloween is as  incongruous as for a committed cult satanist coming from a blood sacrifice on  Christmas Eve to get up a creche in his living room and sing &ldquo;Silent Night,  Holy Night&rdquo; with heartfelt, sincere devotion to Baby Jesus.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Ephesians  5:1 admonishes us to &ldquo;be imitators God&rdquo; can you picture the Lord Jesus dressing  up as Satan, or as one of the demons He cast out that week, or perhaps as a  Druid priest, just because it was the Feast of Samhain? Or can you see the  apostles disguising themselves as temple prostitutes or as worshippers of the  god Moloch, to whom the Ca&shy;naanites (and even the Israelites in their darker  days) sacrificed their children? </p>
              <p>Halloween  is a day in which virtually everything that God has called abomination is  glorified. We have no business participating in that at any time, much less in  the name of &ldquo;fun&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s only for one night!&rdquo; you cry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only in fun for the children!&rdquo; If this  is how you feel, then you need to understand what the Word of God says to you:</p>
              <p><em>Learn not the way of the  heathen! (Jer. 10:2 KJV) </em></p>
              <p class="qa">Creative Alternatives</p>
              <p>There  are any number of creative alternatives that can be provided for children on  Halloween without participating in the ancient religious traditions of the  Witches and Satanists. </p>
              <p>I&rsquo;ve  heard Mike Warnke suggest that parents and churches hold costume parties and  have the kids come as bible heroes. (And don&rsquo;t just make it &ldquo;Bidle characters  in general. After all Satan, Baal, Belial, Beelzebub and Molech are mentioned  in there!) Some groups have set up bowling or ice-skating parties. Some  families view the occasion as a witnessing opportunity and hand out gospel  tracts along with the treats. Some churches are now sponsoring &ldquo;bible hous&shy;es&rdquo;,in  which the kids go through and hear different Bible stories read or acted out-a  godly alternative to the haunted house routine. </p>
              <p>One  thing that Hallo&shy;ween should not be for the christian is a time of fear. It  should be a time to rejoice in the fact that the Son of God appeared for this  purpose, that &ldquo;He might destroy the works of the devil&rdquo;.(1 John 3:8) Spend at  least part of this night worshiping God by singing hymns. Above all, spend time  in prayer and intercession for the children.</p>
              <p>It  is tragic that many people in the church have forgotten that &ldquo;God has not given  us a spirit of fear, but of power love and a sound mind.&rdquo;(2 Timothy 1:7 KJV),  and that includes on Hallo&shy;ween! Too many of our children have been made  vulnerable to a spirit of fear and to the occult because we have for so long be&shy;lieved  Halloween to be an innocent season of fun.</p>
              <p>However,  after the appeal of the Witchcraft Act in England in 1951, the Wit&shy;ches and  Satanists experienced a revival which is currently in full swing. You might not  know much about Witches or Satanists or &ldquo;Jason&rdquo; or Freddie Krueger, but I  guarantee you that most of your kids do!</p>
              <p><em>You were formerly darkness, but now you are light in the  Lord: walk as children of light...and do not participate in the unfruitful  deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them.&nbsp; (Eph. 5:8, 11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong><em>Reprinted from &ldquo;Like Lambs to the Slaughter, Your Child &amp;  the Occult,&rdquo; by Johanna Michaelsen published by Harvest House Publishers&nbsp; </em></strong></p>
