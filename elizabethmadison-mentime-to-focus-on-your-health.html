                <p>85% of my  clients are women. Why so few men? Some key reasons. First, women are better at  prioritizing their health. When I reach out to men to talk about their health,  I get the following responses: they're too busy', have other things to focus  on', or generally feel that they are 'not doing too badly'. When men do come to  see me in my private practice, it is usually because they just had a heart  attack or other serious cardiovascular event, or were recently diagnosed with  diabetes or super high cholesterol. Another reason is ego. Men feel they don't  need support, they can 'do this on their own'. But the reality is this: men  need to make their health a priority and they need support to make the  necessary changes. Men have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and  associated mortality than women. African-American and Hispa&shy;nic men have higher  rates with mortality and illness than other  groups. What is really amazing is that of the top 10 leading causes of deaths  in men, 6 are preventable by diet and lifestyle modification. Heart disease  tops the list, closely followed by cancer. Other preventable leading causes of  death include stroke, diabetes, and kidney disease. So for this month, in honor  of Father's Day and Men's Health Month, here are some tips for getting all you  male readers started on your road to wellness. </p>
                <p><strong>Get  good rest.</strong> This is such a basic need, but so few men get enough sleep. And  the long-term effects are devastating. Inadequate sleep is linked to several  chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and  depression. Lack of sleep is also responsible for unintentional injuries due to  motor vehicle and machinery-related accidents, the leading cause of death in  males under 44 years old. Strive for 7-8 hours  a night so your body can do all its repair work and re&shy;charge itself.  You will wake up more refreshed and energized. You'll also need less caffeine  and sugary foods to keep you going throughout the day. </p>
                <p><strong>Toss  the tobacco.</strong> It is never too late to quit. Quitting sooner not only improves overall health, but also reduces your  risk of heart disease, cancer, lung disease, and other smoking-related  illnesses. Kicking the habit is really hard, so don't do it solo. There are lots of free resources to  help, like www. smokefree.org.</p>
                <p>Also, see a dietitian to support you  through the pro&shy;cess. Why? Because nicotine is known to increase metabolism and  suppress appetite. Once you stop smoking your metabolism decreases and your  appetite is enhanced. A dietitian can help you develop a healthy eating plan to  avoid the weight gain. </p>
                <p><strong>Get  going.</strong> You must move. Period. And you must do it almost daily. Your heart  needs it as well as your lungs, muscles and even your brain. Exercise can help normalize both blood pressure and  blood sugar levels, as well as lower weight. My clients experience significant  improvement in their weight, and heart health once they start exercising. And  this can happen in as little as 2 weeks! It is recommended that adults get at  least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. What type  of activity? Any exercise that you like doing. What counts as  moderate-intensity? If you can carry a tune easily while working out, you&rsquo;re  not working hard enough. So get moving. </p>
                <p><strong>Eat  healthy.</strong> There's no way around it, you are what you eat. You know that  eating foods high in salt, sugar, and saturated fat can result in poor health.  Diets high in salt may contribute to high blood pressure, and eventually heart  disease or even stroke. High sugar diets may increase both weight and insulin  resistance, putting you at risk for a compromised immune system and diabetes.  Too much saturated fat, found mostly in animal protein, can clog arteries. This  restricts both blood and nutrient flow increasing your risk of cardiovascular disease. </p>
                <p>It can be challenging to make the necessary chan&shy;ges for good health.  Your approach will determine your success: making dramatic and fast changes  just leads to feelings of deprivation, and eventual  self-sabotage. Instead, make small changes gradually. Each week or so, make a  goal to change a habit. For example, cut your soda intake in half, eat a  healthy breakfast 4x a week, don't use table salt, exercise for 30 minutes, 3x  a week. Once you feel comfortable with the change, add another one. I have found  this approach very successful with my clients because it increases their  confidence in their ability to maintain heal&shy;thy habits. Another strategy to  improve healthy eating is to make half your plate fruits and veggies every time  you eat. This will automatically increase  your intake of fiber, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other phytochemicals  that help protect you from chronic disease and several types of cancer. Over time, you'll feel better, lighter,  and your body will thank you!</p>
                <p><strong>Stay on top of your game.</strong> Don't  wait until you feel chest pain, or you realize that you&rsquo;re thirsty all the  time, and urinating frequently (signs of diabetes). Schedule regular checkups.  Certain diseases and conditions may be asymptomatic, so routine medical  examinations are important for early detection before the problem gets out of  hand. </p>
                <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t wish it away.</strong> Pay attention  to what your body is telling you, especially  chest pain, shortness of breath, excessive thirst, and problems with  urination. Have questions about your health or side effects due to a  medication? Don&rsquo;t self-diagnose by asking Dr. Google. Speak to your doctor or  pharmacist. Let them be the experts.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>I wish all our Love Express men readers  much health and blessings!</p>
