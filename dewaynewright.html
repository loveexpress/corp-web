            <h4 id="articleTitle">A Call to Contend for The Faith&rdquo;</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by DeWayne Wright, Youth Pastor</p>
            </div>
      <p ><em>Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.&rdquo; Jude 3 ESV (English Standard Version)</em></p>
      <p>This is a crucial time for ministry, especially youth ministry, and it&rsquo;s time for a change. Activities alone are not enough. Young people are &ldquo;growing up&rdquo; in youth ministry, but not in &ldquo;The Faith.&rdquo; Without really knowing what they believe, they are going off to college or into &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; and converting to other religions. Because young people do not know what &ldquo;The Faith&rdquo; is, their foundation isn&rsquo;t strong enough to handle the attacks on their convictions. There is a shifting taking place, and it is call to contend for The Faith!</p>
      <p>The shifting I&rsquo;m referring to is changing our focus to make sure our young people understand who God is and who they are in God, and that this becomes our greatest priority. Fun and fellowship are fine, but God is seeking young people who will not compromise their faith and who will stand for Him in these last days. You can look around you and see that we are in the last days. It doesn&rsquo;t take a rocket scientist to recognize the signs and see that the Lord&rsquo;s return is upon us. With &ldquo;another gospel&rdquo; being preached (Galatians 1:7), we are losing our young people to sexual sin, drugs, gangs and many other things that are more successful at grabbing our young people&rsquo;s attention than the local youth group. In order to heed the call to contend for the faith, as youth pastors and youth ministers, we must first understand the faith for ourselves.</p>
      <p>I want to submit to you that the definition of faith is not Hebrews 11:1. When you look it up in the Greek, you will find that faith is &ldquo;a belief system, an assurance, a reliance upon Christ for salvation, and a strong persuasion based upon conviction of the truth or the truthfulness of God.&rdquo; This definition is extremely important if we are going to contend for the faith. Faith is vital to anyone&rsquo;s salvation. We know from Hebrews 11:6 that without it, there is no way we can please God. It takes faith in the finished work of the cross to be saved. Yes, salvation is by grace but it THROUGH faith (Ephesians 2:10). This faith that we are to contend for is important to comprehend and live by.</p>
      <p>Our faith in Christ should direct our lives every single day. It is not a one time deal but a moment by moment lifestyle. The young people of today are missing the connection between what they profess in church and what they live in the streets, at home and in school. The Christianity that has been presented to them requires nothing more from them than a single prayer of forgiveness and a confession of the Lordship of Jesus. The repentance piece is missing from the faith of these young people. According to The Bridger Generation by Thom S. Ranier, in five years there will only be four percent Bible-believing orthodox Christians in the U.S. If we want to change that statistic, we are going to have to do something that we are not doing, which is presenting the Christ of the Bible instead of the Christ of religion and of our society.</p>
      <p>The Faith includes the following (this is not an exhaustive list): the virgin birth of Jesus, the creation of man, the fall of man, the resurrection of the dead, the doctrine of baptisms, the judgements of God, repentance from dead works, faith towards God, the cross, One God and His son Jesus Christ, and that salvation can only come through Jesus. Without these fundamental doctrines, the next generation will not have a foundation to stand upon. We have to go back to what the Bible teaches and begin to teach today&rsquo;s teenager. How can this generation contend for a faith they do not know? The shifting requires youth specialists to examine what they are doing in their youth ministry, and why. Our methods are as important as our motives. As youth pastors and ministers, we must stop watering down the gospel and begin to raise the standards in our youth ministries. We must know what the Word of God says and proclaim it with boldness. We must begin to trust God to invade our ministries with His glory and power! It is going to take the power of God to change the lives of these teenagers. Let us arise and embrace the shifting...</p>
