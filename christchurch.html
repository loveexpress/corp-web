              <p ><strong>Dr.  David &amp; Pastor Marlinda Ireland</strong></p>
<p>On June 28, 2009 <strong>Christ Church</strong> had announced the opening of its interim sanctuary at  140 Green Pond Road, Roc&shy;kaway, New Jer&shy;sey. Worship services are now being  held on Sundays at 9am and 11:30am at the 1,067-seat sanctuary.</p>
              <p>Christ Church, an independent,  non-denominatio&shy;nal Christian congregation, is expanding beyond its current  location in Montclair, New Jersey to ease the de&shy;mands of serving its growing  congregation of some 6,000 members.</p>
              <p>The church acquired the 107-acre  property from Agilent Technologies in 2005 and moved its administrative offices  from Verona, NJ, to the Rockaway Township site that same year. In Oc&shy;to&shy;ber  2007, the interim sanctuary won approval from the Rockaway Township Plann&shy;ing  Board, and construction of its interim sanctuary be&shy;gan six months later.</p>
              <p>The church was awar&shy;ded its Certificate  of Occu&shy;pancy from the Rockaway Township Building Depart&shy;ment on June 1, 2009.  Construction of the interim sanctuary began August 1, 2008 and was completed at  the end of May 2009. The in&shy;terim sanctuary is expected to advance Christ  Church&rsquo;s history of facilitating community beautification and economic  resour&shy;ces to Mont&shy;clair and its surrounding areas by enriching the worship,  business, and cultural diversity of Morris County area parishioners and  residents. The church will conti&shy;nue serving people in and around Essex County  through its five weekend ser&shy;vices in Montclair. The two Sunday services in  Rocka&shy;way will be additional opportunities for the church to serve its growing  community of worshippers that pre&shy;sently represents some 40 different  nationalities.</p>
              <p>&ldquo;We are delighted to have received the  Certifi&shy;cate of Occupancy from Rockaway Township,&rdquo; said The Rev. Dr. David  Ireland, senior pastor of Christ Church. &ldquo;Seeing the fruition of our plans to  offer worship in Morris County has been long awaited and we are excited to open  our doors to our neighbors. In fact, many neighbors have been dropping by daily  to inquire about when the church will begin services because they want to  participate. Now, we are able to provide them with a clear answer that is sure  to generate excitement in the community.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Christ Church will offer a wide array  of community-based programs and services aimed at supporting and enriching the  lives of members and visitors of all ages through its new facility.</p>
              <p>Features of the Interim&nbsp; Sanctuary: The 1,067-seat sanctuary includes,  state-of-the-art audio/visual/lighting systems, high-definition televisions for  ease of viewing throughout the sanctuary, wood grain flooring, and decorative  carpeting. Other key features of the sanctuary include:</p>
              <ul><li> 845 parking spaces available for the  congregation </li><li> Four children&rsquo;s classrooms and a  separate Teen Church </li><li> Translation Room offering translation  services from English to Spanish</li><li> A family-care room for parents to  care for babies and children </li><li> Parent Pager, a compute&shy;rized  check-in system us&shy;ing photo recognition to safeguard children when parents  drop off and pick up little ones at Children&rsquo;s Church.</li></ul><!--_step1-->
              <p>The interim sanctuary also features  stained-glass murals, theater-style seating, wood grain flooring and decorative  carpeting. The worship space is also equipped with Parent Pa&shy;ger, a  computerized check-in system using photo re&shy;cognition to safeguard children  when pa&shy;rents and guardians drop off and pick up little ones at Children&rsquo;s  Church; a media studio for the playback of videos; and state-of-the-art  audio/visual/lighting systems to en&shy;hance clarity of the entire worship  experience and theatrical productions.7</p>
