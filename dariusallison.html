            <h4 id="articleTitle">Creation-vs-Evolution</h4>
            <div id="authorname"><p>by Darius K. Allison</div>
              <p>Throughout New York and several other regions a theory known as evolution is being taught in many schools, causing confusion to thousands of young minds each and everyday. Many believe that science is the complete explanation for this wonderful earth as well as the universe; however, mankind is just to na&iuml;ve to even grasp the concept of our amazing God and his creations. Evolution versus Creationism has been a constant argument to the point where a man named Mike Zovath decided to found a museum that completely turned the theory of evolution on its head. God blessed my family and I with the opportunity to take a trip to the creation museum in Kentucky, Ohio.</p>
              <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic"><img src="images/ark.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="150" />            </div>
              <p>This awe-inspiring, sixty thousand square foot museum consists of the Darwinism theory as well as creationism, both being referenced back to the book of Genesis. The creation museum takes the book of genesis into hand and completely brings it to real life. Starting in Genesis one, as it speaks upon the creation of Adam and Eve the museum displays three dimensional real life forms, charts that read creationism facts against the evolution theory. From the moment we entered the museum it was an amazing sight to witness the peace and comfort that humans previously shared with animals we now call &ldquo;earthly beasts.&rdquo; Ranging from tigers, lions, even dinosaurs, the Garden of Eden showed man mingling and fellowshipping with these animals. Scientists believe there was no possible way this was all true or any way our world after Noah&rsquo;s flood is only four thousand, three hundred and fifty years old rather than millions. Archeologists have studied the fossils of dinosaurs and have truly admitted that there is no other way that these bones would be buried under so many rocks and sediments other than the event of a flood.</p>
              <p>This world has been tested time after time and miracles have occurred throughout millions of lives as well as horrible things do. Mankind is not ready to accept the good with the bad such as Charles Darwin was not. Thousands of people are dedicated to the theory of evolution; but little do they know the man that created it, Charles Darwin was a devout Christian until a tragic event occurred in his life as he lost his daughter to a deadly disease. This tragedy forced him to turn his back on God and forced him to establish a theory which eliminates God in the Creation of our universe. To see is to believe? I&rsquo;m afraid not the opposite is true. To believe in our Lord God is to truly see the amazing universe he has created.</p>
              <p>I sat in a science class and listened to the instructor teach all of us that man evolved from apes and God had nothing to do with it. Worse than that there was not one person willing to speak out and debate against this whole theory of evolution. I found myself alone in the battle to get the truth out and known. However, I was fortunate enough to have a teacher open to discussion because my cousin sat in his science class and wasn&rsquo;t even allowed to speak on the subject because the teacher was afraid of getting fired for allowing a student to speak about God. The debate on Creationism-vs-Evolutionism is a topic for science and as students we should be allowed to speak on the side of Creationism if the school insists on teaching Evolutionism. I say to students everywhere do not sit silent in your classroom. There is plenty of literature on the internet, in the library and I highly recommend The Creation Museum if you have an opportunity to see it. There is also a publication &ldquo;Answers in Genesis&rdquo; which is a great source of knowledge to empower you with the facts about Creationism-vs-Evolutionism.  I challenge all young people to know the truth, God&rsquo;s truth. Creation Museum is located at 28 Bullittsburg Church Road, Petersburg, Kentucky 41080.
