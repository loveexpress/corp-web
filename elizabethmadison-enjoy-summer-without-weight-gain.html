                <p>I&nbsp;love summer! I love the hot weather, long days  of sunshine, and spending time with family and friends at BBQs, picnics and  other social events that fill my calendar during this season. However, it is  also a time when maintaining my heal&shy;thy weight can be a struggle because I am  surrounded by delicious and tempting, calorie-heavy foods that are a mainstay  of this season - think ribs, burgers, potato salad, and ice-cream. To keep me  on track, I developed some effective strategies that have helped me, and my  clients, manage summer. If this season is a challenge for you, try some of  these tips.</p>
                <p><strong>Keep a  food log.</strong> This is  absolutely the best approach to staying aware of your eating habits! It is also  Bible based: Habakkuk 2:2. You won&rsquo;t develop &lsquo;food amnesia&rsquo; if you record  everything you eat and drink each day. You won&rsquo;t &lsquo;forget&rsquo; you had 2 scoops of  that rum raisin ice cream. Many of my clients are shocked when they realize how  much they consume each day! That realization leads to healthy changes in food  choices and quantity, especially when attending social events. Keeping a daily  food log can help you plan your food intake for the day. If you have a BBQ on  your schedule, you can plan for a healthy breakfast and a light snack before  earlier in the day so the BBQ won&rsquo;t become a calorie disaster. <a href="naomi-williams--the-five-star-man.html">naomi-williams--the-five-star-man</a>Thanks to apps  like MyFitnessPal or Lose It! it is now easier than ever to track your food and  manage your weight.</p>
                <p><strong>Have a  plan.</strong> When  attending social events, you may not know what&rsquo;s on the me&shy;nu. An easy way to  stay on track is to follow the MyPlate approach: make half your plate veggies  and fruit, 1/4 starch, and 1/4 protein. You&rsquo;ll still be able to have your fried  chicken and mac &amp; cheese, but you&rsquo;ll offset those calories if the rest of  your plate is filled with collard greens and salad.</p>
                <p><strong>Focus  on the company, not the food</strong>.  What&rsquo;s on the menu should not be the first thing on your mind when attending a  social event. If your head is focused on the buffet table, you&rsquo;re more likely  to overeat and make unhealthy choices. Instead, change your mindset to focus on  your family and friends. Remembering what a blessing it is to be with them can  help take the focus off the food. Read Romans 12:2 to rework your mental  approach.</p>
                <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t  cook.</strong> If the mere  thought of cooking in the summer makes you hot, then don&rsquo;t. But be careful  about eating out more than occasionally because it can wreak havoc on your  waistline. Instead, keep a variety of vegetables on hand for an easy, no-cook  salad. Make a&nbsp; big batch of grilled  vegetables and store away in the fidge for a quick sandwich or side dish. A  colorful fruit sa&shy;lad prominently positioned in the fridge can help you manage your  ice cream craving. Need ideas for some no-cook healthy summer reci&shy;pes?

                <p><strong>Do your  homework.</strong> Craving our  favorite foods is natural. For some it may be ice cream, others, French fries. Whatever  your indulgence is, be aware-know what it is go&shy;ing to cost you in calories.  Find out how many calories, fat, sodium, and sugar is contained in a single  serving. If you are going to a restaurant, plan ahead and look at the nutritional  facts, available for most online. Armed with this information, you can make a  conscious, and hopefully healthy, choice.</p>
                <p><strong>Be a  healthy host.</strong> If you&rsquo;re  hosting the party, take control of the menu. Create mouth-watering dishes using  seasonal fruits and vegetables, low-fat protein and healthy fats. Jazz up old  recipe favorites with simple ingredient swaps. Skip the heavy appetizers and  offer healthier fare like finger sandwiches, fresh fruit, ve&shy;ge&shy;table sticks,  and whole-grain baked tortilla chips with vegetarian-based dips such as hummus  or salsa. For dessert, try colorful yogurt parfaits. Swap out soda and other  sugary beverages by making your own &ldquo;vitamin&rdquo; water: cut up fresh fruit and  submerge them in a tall pit&shy;cher of iced water. Not only will your guests enjoy  the colorful display, you&rsquo;ll feel good about serving healthier options.</p>
                <p><strong>Offer  to bring a dish.</strong> If you  are invited to a house party or backyard BBQ take the initiative and offer to  bring either an entree or side dish instead of dessert. Prepare something that  you can incorporate into your healthy eating plan. This way, you&rsquo;ll have at  least one healthy option. You can then take smal&shy;ler amounts of the other food  selections.</p>
                <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t drink your calories.</strong> Outdoor  events can become uncomfortably hot in the summer months, so remember to stay  hydrated. Minimize the sugar laden iced teas and opt for water or seltzer as  your go-to beverage. Add a squeeze of fresh citrus or some refreshing mint,  ber&shy;ries, or even cucumbers for variety.</p>
                <p>These  tips can help you enjoy your summer without getting derailed. I wish you much  health and happiness. <strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For  more healthy eating tips, visit my website at www.weightlosstransformation.
