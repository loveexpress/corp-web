                <p>The praise ship has taken off again; <strong>first stop</strong> was in Hempstead, NY for the  &ldquo;Word of Faith Deliverance Ministry&rdquo; with the beautiful anointed host <strong>Pastor Betty Brown</strong>. This really was a  beautiful luncheon with a room full of powerful anointed women. Their theme for  this conference was &ldquo;I hear the sound of the Abundance of rain.&rdquo; Pastor Brown  is one of the most humble and loving wo&shy;man I  have ever come across and I just love to be in her presence. The  luncheon started out with a flag dance of praise by Teisha Moore, who danced  unto the Lord and also gave a short word about the rain coming, a change is  about to come.</p>
                <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic"><img src="images/pic2.jpg" width="375" height="246"></div>
                <p><strong>Prophetess  Francine Norman</strong> of Dallas, Texas, a true anointed woman of  God gave us a mighty word from God to keep us and sustain us. She went on to  say we need to reconstruct our inter-structure and form a dream team to help us  complete the vision God has given us. The five points were: you need a  confidant, coach, friend, play mate and a  Judas. These are the five points she elaborated on and opened our eyes  and ears to better understanding of what vision God has given us and what to do  with it. I thank you Pastor Brown for the invite. It was just what I needed.</p>
                <p><strong>Next stop</strong> was in  Jamaica, NY at the New York Hilton at JFK Airport for the Intercessory Ministry  International Seventeenth Annual Prayer breakfast. Our host <strong>Rev. Newton Gabbidon</strong> started this  ministry with wanting to formulate a pra&shy;yer band for the people of Jamaica,  started with family members and friends and expanded to churches all over the  world to include everyone in prayer. Rev. Gabbidon introduced me to the speaker  of the hour <strong>Bi&shy;shop Joseph Garlington</strong>,  PhD. Bishop Garlington is the Senior  Pastor at Covenant Church of Pittsburgh, a  multi-cultural and cross-cultural community of three thousand strong. This church was founded by  Bishop Garlington and his wife. This was one of the times where you interview  someone and you thoroughly enjoy the Q &amp; A. Bishop Garlington is  charismatic and anointed man of God. He made my job so easy for me. I really  can understand why Bishop&rsquo;s church has  the growth it has because he is so easy going and knowledgeable. More than  that, he loves people and meets the need of the people whether it is the youth,  seniors, or cultural. Bishop Garlington I salute you.</p>

                <p><strong>Next stop</strong> the LE Praise ship made  a solo flight back to the beautiful land of Har&shy;lem NY. While Harlem&rsquo;s very own  radio station, WHCR 90.3FM (WHCR.org), was playing quite loudly in my 
                headphones, I landed on 125th Street in  the back of the LaGree Baptist Church for the homegoing service of my friend,  the legendary Edgar Kendricks.<br>
  </p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.  Kendricks, to me Bro. Edgar, was entitled &ldquo;the unofficial mayor of Sunday morning  churchin.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a church in Har&shy;lem that Bro Edgar hasn&rsquo;t been  their pianist or organist. As one of Harlem&rsquo;s flashiest dressers and the 1st  cousin to the Temptation&rsquo;s Eddie Kendricks, during the late 1960s and early  1970s, Ed&shy;gar led a house band at the Apollo Theater, where he performed with  the likes of Marvin Gaye, O. C. Smith and Jerry Butler. He headed a gospel  ensemble called &ldquo;Listen My Brother&rdquo;; a gospel group which included a teen&shy;age  Luther Vandross. He al&shy;so wrote and arranged children&rsquo;s songs for Sesame  Street, including educational songs like &ldquo;Count to 20&rdquo; and &ldquo;Song of the  Alphabets.&rdquo;<br>
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was  a packed house as many of Edgar&rsquo;s family, church family, friends, and fellow musicians came to pay homage to such a  great man and musician. Many of Har&shy;lem&rsquo;s WHCR,&nbsp;  radio personalities and DJs, who played his music on a regular, was also  on hand to celebrate his life. As I lifted off after the saying goodbye to his  sisters Georgia and Ollie, I threw in one of Edgars CDs and played my favorite  song all the way back to the <strong>Love  Express</strong> office, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Happy Tonight&rdquo;. Bro. Edgar, we are all gonna miss you.<br>
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Last stop</strong> was in Floral Park, NY at the  Floral Terrace for the wedding of <strong>Marc</strong> and <strong>Christie</strong> <strong>Thomas</strong>, my babies. There are times in our lives where we grow so  attached to certain people they become either your children or new parents. For  me they have become my babies whom I am so very proud of. Marriage is not an  easy institution, nor is it to be taken likely. Marc and Chris&shy;tie honored God  by becoming man and wife and be- coming  one with God. May God bless this union  and may it last until death do they part. Congrats to you both. Welcome back to  school to all students and teachers.<br>
