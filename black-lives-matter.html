              <div id="authorname"><!--SECTION LEFT END-->
 </div>
              
              <p>The two  largest Pentecostal denominations in the U.S. have called with one voice for  Christians worldwide have affirmed on Sunday, Dec. 14 that indeed &quot;Black  Lives Matter,&quot; and, as admonished in Scripture, to &quot;mourn with those  who mourn&quot; &mdash; in this case, with black Americans who feel the justice  system has failed in two recent cases involving the death of black males at the  hands of white police offi&shy;cers.</p>
              <p>&quot;The lives of all people are  precious to God, of course, but at the present moment, many of our black brothers  and sisters in COGIC and the AG feel that their lives are not highly valued by  many in white America,&quot; says Assemblies of God General Superintendent Dr.  George O. Wood in a statement made public Thursday. &quot;As examples, they  point to the recent controversial decisions of grand juries in St. Louis  County, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, not to return bills of  indictment against white police officers in the deaths of two black males,  Michael Brown and Eric Garner.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;Whatever your opinion of those  controversial decisions, can we stand with our brothers and sisters and affirm  the value of black lives generally and of their lives specifically?&quot; Wood  adds. &quot;Scripture teaches that God does not take pleasure in the death of people, not even the death of the  wicked (Ezekiel 33:11). If so, then whatever the circumstances, we can be  certain that God did not take pleasure in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric  Garner. Therefore, neither should we.&quot;</p>
              <p>Wood goes on to ask members if they  would be willing to &quot;affirm, then, the grief our black brothers and sisters feel about these men's deaths?&quot;  He sugges&shy;ted that readers consider: &quot;If the families and friends of  Michael Brown and Eric Garner attended your church, how would you minister to  them in their sorrow?&quot;</p>
              <p>The statement from the Assemblies of  God, which counts 3 million members and adherents in the United States and an  additional 67 million members worldwide, came a week after Bishop Charles E.  Blake issued a public appeal for the observance of &quot;Black Lives Matter  Sunday.&quot;</p>
              <p>Blake is Presiding Bi&shy;shop of the Church  of God in Christ, Inc. (COGIC), a predominantly-black Pentecos&shy;tal  organization, the largest in the U.S., that  counts nearly 6.5 million members globally.</p>
              <p>&quot;I am  grateful for this unprecedented letter and show of support from  Dr. George O. Wood, General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God. Dr. Wood  and the AG demonstrate the love and healing power of Christ by standing with  the Church of God in Christ to categorically say,  black lives matter,&quot; wrote Blake in a statement dated Dec. 12 but  made available a day prior.</p>
              <p>In his original Dec. 5 declaration of  &quot;Black Lives Matter Sunday,&quot; Blake stated that the Sunday show of  solidarity was to &quot;remind the nation how important the lives of African  Americans are.&quot;</p>
              <p>The bishop added that COGIC &quot;will  sponsor (this) day of prayer throughout its 12,000  congregations around the world, in honor&quot; of Garner and Brown.</p>
              <p>In addition to special prayer to be  offered for the men present during those services, the Assemblies of God has  asked participants to also:</p>
              <p>&bull; Pray during the service that God would bless  the ministries of the Church of God in Christ, our own National Black  Fellowship, and the many AG multicultural churches, enlarging their territory  through Spirit-guided influence on the communities where they minister.</p>
              <p>&bull; Pray that God would unite the hearts of all  Spirit-filled believers, but especially COGIC and the AG, so that together, we  would become a &quot;Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings&quot;  (Isaiah 58:12) in our nation.</p>
              <p>&bull; Pray for law enforcement and judicial  officers, especially Spirit-filled believers among them, that they would be  servants of justice, reconciliation, and peace in the communities they serve.</p>
              <p>&quot;We must find a way, through God's  help, to continue the work of emphatical&shy;ly telling everyone that will listen  that, 'Black Lives Matter!' implored COGIC's Blake in his declaration.</p>
              <p>Wood, the Assemblies of God leader,  referenced the special season, writing that &quot;at this Christmas season, may  we take to heart once again the glorious announcement  of the angel that the birth of Jesus is 'good news that will cause great  joy for all the people' (Luke 2:10, emphasis added)!&quot;</p>
