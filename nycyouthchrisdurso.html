              Credits Creativity for Ministry Success<br />

              <p>A&nbsp;youth ministry in New York City is changing  the way the Gospel reaches unchurched young adults under the direction of  Pastor Chris Durso, who embraces creativity as  a big part of his ministry's success.</p>
              <p>Durso and his  wife Yah&shy;ris lead Misfit NYC, part of Christ Tabernacle Church,  where young individuals take the initiative to reach others by using their  talents in the arts every Friday night. Their purpose is to demonstrate how God  can be seen as freedom and not as religion or law.</p>
              <p>&quot;If I'm going to be different, I  know there's going to be opposition and people who are against it but I'm all  about stepping out and trying anything new,&quot; Durso said during an  interview with pastor Paula White. &quot;What I've learned is that I'm not  called to color outside the lines but I'm supposed to co&shy;lor the way God wants  me to color within His parameters and that's  the best way to use our creativity.&quot;</p>
              <p>For the last  seven years, Durso has made it a point to incorporate relevant elements into  their gatherings including acting, dancing, and spoken word. He notes  that at one point New York City was known as a &quot;church graveyard,&quot;  however, their ministry has proven the opposite.</p>
              <p>Misfit NYC began as his older brother  Adam's vision 18 years ago, which at the time was called &quot;Youth  Explosion.&quot; The group attracted countless youth throughout New York and  garnered national media attention as it continued  to grow because of their unconventional methods of reaching the youth.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Durso admits that as a kid he  never wanted to become a pastor because he saw how arduous his father, Michael,  worked in ministry while at Brooklyn Tabernacle, then as senior pastor of  Christ Tabernacle. He also underestimated the calling placed on his life due to  his attention deficit disorder.</p>
              <p>&quot;I grew up with ADD and I always  felt like it would be difficult for me to get ahead and even preach the gospel.  I put this weight on myself and said that I was never go&shy;ing to be able to do  this at all and on top of it, I never knew I would be in youth ministry,&quot;  said Durso.</p>
              <p>Adam eventually han&shy;ded the reins of the  ministry over to Durso, but he did not immediately take up the opportunity to  continue growing the group.</p>
              <p>&quot;It was a lot of back and forth  with me because I didn't believe in myself,&quot; said Durso. &quot;There can  be a calling on your life but you don't believe in yourself that you can be  used by God, then you're not going to be successful&hellip;this is why we have a lot  of insecure leaders.&quot;</p>
              <p>When he first took over, Durso admits  that the youth ministry was reduced to 100 individuals  because although he had a vision for  the group's growth, he was &quot;thinking different but not according to  the will of God.&quot;</p>
              <p>&quot;My brother already had an  out-of-the-box ministry with hip-hop, spoken word and by taking a different  approach on worship and preaching but when I came on I said, 'we're going to do  this but I'm not going to do any of that. We're just going to do worship and  word' and we saw the ministry deflate really quick,&quot; said Durso.</p>
              <p>However, after getting pressure from his  father to improve his outreach methods, Durso says he devoted a day to seek  God's guidance. He met with his leadership team that week to discuss new  strategies and a new vision for the ministry emerged soon after.</p>
              <p>&quot;This ministry was perishing and I  kid you not, that Friday we were at 500 people,&quot; said Durso. &quot;There  was no advertisement, no social media blast, it was all because of  obedience.&quot;</p>
              <p>Now, Misfit NYC is known as one of the  largest youth ministries in New York City and continues to grow through their  unconventional spreading of the Gospel. Each year, the group also hosts Misfit  NYC Conference designed to pour into the lives of the next generation.</p>
