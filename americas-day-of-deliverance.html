              <p><strong><em>This Fourth of July Ameri&shy;ca celebrates it&rsquo;s 239th birthday!  The Fourth of Ju&shy;ly is one of our most-celebrated holidays, a fact confirmed by  a very elder&shy;ly John Quincy Adams in a speech he delivered July 4, 1837 -  America&rsquo;s 61st birthday.</em></strong></p>
              
              <p>John Quincy Adams properly reminded the  crowd that one of the most important elements of the American movement for  independence had been it&rsquo;s spiritual underpinnings. He asked:</p>
              <p>Why  is it that, next to the birthday of the Savior of the World, our most joyous  and most venerated festival occurs on this day? And why is it that...thousands  and tens of thousands among us ...year after year...celebrate the birthday of  the nations? Is it not that...the birthday of the nation is indissolubly linked  with the birthday of the Savior? That it forms a leading event in the progress  of the Gospel dispensation? Is it not that the Declaration of Independence  first organized the social compact on the founda- tion of the Redeemer&rsquo;s  mission upon earth? That it laid the cornerstone of human government upon the  first precepts of Christianity?</p>
              <p>The  fact that there was a spiritual emphasis at the birth of the nation was  confirmed by numerous others. For example, Benjamin Kent, in a letter to Samuel  Adams, declared: &ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s doing!&rdquo;</p>
              <p>So  clearly did John Adams see God&rsquo;s hand in America&rsquo;s independence, he even  believed that to help America achieve her independence was the single reason  God had created him. As he told his wife, Abigail: &ldquo;The Colonies must be  declared free &amp; independent States... When these things shall be once well  finished, or in a way of being so, I shall think that I have answered the end  of my crea&shy;tion.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>In  a similar tone, John Page (later a Virginia governor) told Thomas Jefferson, &ldquo;I  am highly pleased with your Declaration. God preserve the United States! We  know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong (Ecclesiastes  9:11). D o you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this  storm?&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Yet,  declaring independence was only the beginn&shy;ing. Much sacrifice, patience and  reliance on God would still be required. As signer of the declaration, Abraham  Clark explained:&ldquo;This seems now to begin a trying season; but that indulgent  Father who hath hitherto pre- served us will, I trust, appear for our help, and  prevent our being crushed; if otherwise, His will be done.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Our  founders knew that without God&rsquo;s help - or, as they announced in the  declaration itself-&rdquo;a firm reliance on...divine Providence&rdquo;-they would never  achieve their objective.</p>
              <p>While  we celebrate our liberties this year, let us not forget that those liberties  came only through great, personal sacrifice: Nine of the 56 signers of the  declaration died during the war. Five were captured by the British and tortured  before their deaths. Twelve had their homes destroyed by British troops, and  three lost their sons to the enemy. Such sa&shy;crifices remind us that liberty is  never free-every generation must defend it anew.</p>
              <p>The  possibility that we might forget the sacrifices necessary to preserve liberty  was something which troubled our founders. This was made clear in a letter from  Dr. Benjamin Rush to John Adams after witnessing the celebration surrounding  America&rsquo;s 35th birthday in 1811. Dr. Rush told Mr. Adams:</p>
              <p>The  4th of July has been celebrated in Philadelphia in the manner I expected. The  military men, and particularly one of them, ran away with all the glory of the  day. But scarcely a word was said of the solicitude and labors and fears and  sorrows and sleepless nights of the men who projected, proposed, defen&shy;ded, and  subscribed [signed] the Declaration of Independence. Do you recollect your  memorable speech upon the day on which the vote was ta&shy;ken? Do you recollect  the pensive and awful silence which pervaded the House when we were called up,  one after another, to the table of the President of Congress [John Hancock] to  subscribe what was believed by many at that time to be our own death  warrants?...</p>
              <p>While  we should remember the sacrifices, it is more important that we remember the  proper manner to celebrate the Fourth of July. What is the proper manner? The  answer was given in a letter John Adams wrote to Abigail on the day they  approved the declaration. He forecast: &ldquo;I am apt to believe that [this day]  will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the &lsquo;Day of Deliverance&rsquo; by solemn  acts of devotion to God Almighty!&rdquo;</p>
              <p>Celebrate  the Fourth of July with fireworks, festivities and parades. But also celebrate  it by setting aside a time to thank God for His numerous blessings upon our  country.</p>
              <p><em>&ldquo;A holy  faith burned in the spirits and guided the actions of all those who set in  motion the establishment of these United States of America. Their won words  bear testimony to this truth. And it is no accident that in the few words  chosen to declare independence on that summer morning, the Name of Al&shy;mighty  God appears as testimony to the faith of our fathers.&rdquo; </em></p>
