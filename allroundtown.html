            <div id="articlepic" class="imgdrop"><img src="images/bis-hez-walker-ms-gee-and-luis-palau.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192" id="authorpic" /> </div>
              
              <p><strong>The First Stop</strong> was at <strong>Calvary Baptist Church</strong> in Manhattan,  where <strong>Pastor Epstein</strong> is the senior  Pastor, for the City serve-City Fest. This  ministry is hosted by the <strong>Luis  Palau Foundation</strong>. What I found most amazing about this conference was the  coming together of many churches regardless of color and religion. I looked to  my left I saw my Latinos brother and sisters, mixed in with my Afri&shy;can  American brothers and sisters, mixed in with white, Chinese and so on. It remin&shy;ded  me how it would be in heaven, all of us in one accord, with one thing on our  minds praising our Father. City serve, City Fest is not about one person but  all God&rsquo;s children serving the community and letting the community know about  the good news of Jesus Christ. The key note  was presented by <strong>Luis</strong> <strong>Palau,</strong> if he ever wanted to  change careers, he would be a great comedian.&nbsp; </p>
            <div id="articlepic" class="imgdrop"></div>
              <p>Elder Palau just expressed it will take  all us to come together to make this great, not just one of us or a few of us.  His son Kevin said well &ldquo;This is where we put down our egos &amp; logos and  lift up the name of Jesus,&rdquo; Luis Palau went on to say it is the time to  celebrate &amp; accelerate to impact different ways to serve the church. City  Serve will first have local city walks which includes painting cleaning and  sprucing up the neighborhoods. Regional outreach will be all over the tri-state  area that will showcase different fa&shy;cets of this ministry. Lastly but of  course, there will be a huge multicultural outdoor concert. It really is not  just about cleaning up the neighborhoods, creating gardens, but most  importantly creating relationships and introducing the community to  Christ.&nbsp; </p>
            <div id="articlepic" class="imgdrop"></div>
              <p>So many pastors came through to show  their support, (too many to name eve&shy;rybody) Dr. A.R. Bernard, Pastor Floyd  Flake, Pastor Althea Taylor, Youth Pastor Jeremy Rios Esq., Bishop Hector  Banano, Pastor Cymbala, and we cannot forget Bishop Hezekiah Walker, who  directed everyone attending to sing the number one song in the country and  written by Elder David Bratton, &ldquo;Every Praise.&rdquo; We got a glimpse of heaven  seeing everyone singing on one accord.&nbsp;  If you would like to be a part of this great movement just go to  www.NYCIty Serve.org/launch. </p>

              <p><strong>Next Stop </strong>was in  Brooklyn, NY at <strong>Full Faith Christian</strong> <strong>Center, for Beauty for Ashes Global  Outreach Mi&shy;nistries</strong> <strong>Third  Anniversary</strong> hosted by <strong>First Lady</strong> <strong>Jea&shy;nette Willi&shy;ams</strong>. This was one of  the most anoin&shy;ted and powerful anniversary I have ever had the pleasure to go  to and the honor of being the MC. The dance ministry who started off the  service was &ldquo;For His Glory&rdquo;, an awesome dance ministry and Lady Candace Edge  brought us in the presence of the most high. The icing on the cake was my big  sister and anointed woman of God, <strong>Apostle Patricia Wiley</strong>, gave us  a mighty word that will last me a life time. I pray that Beauty to Ashes last  forever, for it is a much needed ministry.</p>

              <p> <strong>Next  stop</strong> we landed in New Haven CT. for the ordination to Eldership of our <strong>Min. Elder Larnel Satchel</strong> held at <strong>Mt. Calvary Holy Church Revival Center</strong>,  where the Senior Pastor is <strong>Elder Daniel B. Bland</strong>. What made this so very special is that  Elder Bland himself preached this ordination and our sister, <strong>Loretta Satchel</strong>, also was ordained as a  trus&shy;tee. It was a pleasure for doc and I to join our family on such an  astounding occasion. Congrats to all the candidates and may God bless you all  and thank you Elder Clay Johnson for leading us to worship.<br clear="all">
              <br clear="all">

            <div id="articlepic" class="imgdrop"><img src="images/missy-billups-ms-gee-dj-skerrit-bwoy-top-elder-bratton-tim-anderson-and-ms-gabby.jpg" alt="" name="authorpic" width="300" height="192" id="authorpic3" /></div>
              <p> <strong>Next</strong> we slid into Canticles at the <strong>Gospel  Lighthouse</strong> for Panel Discussion on Mu&shy;sic, ministry and marriage-how  artists balance all three. This was a great opportunity for artists to  understand and perfect their craft. It was a great opportunity for anyone who  had questions but did not know who to turn too. Our panelists were, Dove winner <strong>Elder David Bratton</strong>, <strong>Timothy</strong>, <strong>Gaby</strong> <strong>Cudjoe</strong>, <strong>Missy Billups</strong> who also blessed us in  song with a new look and a new sound. This  was one event every artist needed to be there to help with their ministry.</p>
            <div id="articlepic" class="imgdrop"><img src="images/ms-gee-n-sherri-johnson.jpg" alt="" name="authorpic" width="300" height="172" id="authorpic4" /></div>
              <p> <strong>Next  stop</strong> Germantown PA for the surprise party for Dr.D&rsquo;s sister <strong>Sherri</strong>. Dr. D was the surprise DJ and  believe me she was very surprised when she saw Dr. D and I. It was so wonderful  to see our Godmother Ma Ton&shy;ya and to meet our new niece. Anytime you are with  people who really love you it is a pleasure to go out of your way. Great to see  Pam, her mother, Trevor, little Dee, Tamika Patton and April and let us not  forget the wonderful parents who gave birth to this awesome woman who look out  for the underprivileged and always finding ways to help people in any way she  can.</p>

              <p>Very <strong>last stop </strong>Crest Hollow  Country club in Woodbury, NY for the wedding of our niece and new nephew <strong>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jamaal Miller</strong>. Our niece <strong>Shaunte</strong> was so beautiful and Jamaal,  was just so handsome. If you have never been to Crest Hollow the food is divine  and the atmosphere perfect. It was a beautiful occasion, along with family and  friends. Seeing a man and woman up holding the principals of God&rsquo;s word is  always pleasing. Congrats Shaunte and Jamaal wishing you God&rsquo;s speed.</p>
