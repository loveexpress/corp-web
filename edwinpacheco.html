            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Rev. Edwin Pacheco, Jr.<br />
                <em>GateWay City Church</em></p>
            </div>
      <p >Over the last year, I found myself wrestling with the issue if succession. What does it look like? How should Senior Leaders prepare for it? All these questions have been numerous teachings on the Joshua anointing; which speak new leadership, the Leadership type that can bring the people to a new level, etc.</p>
      <p>All this is true, but in studying I found some great principles that many Senior Leaders fail to exercise and which many Emerging Leaders are not willing to submit to. Here are a few principles I found in the relationship to these 2 men which caused a &ldquo;People of Captivity&rdquo; to become the &ldquo;People of Promise.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="qa">Principle #1:<br />
        Positioning for Success</p>
      <p>Moses identified Joshua&rsquo;s calling and allowed him to operate in it as a young man (Exodus 17:8). Senior Leaders must not allow themselves to become threatened by a younger leaders ability to lead. They should embrace their youth, allow them to lead, yet walk along side Emerging leaders as to guide, direct, protect, and correct them to ensure their success as leaders. <em><strong>Senior Leaders:</strong></em> if your Emerging Leaders become great, it should be because of the investment you made in their lives as their mentor and spiritual overseer.</p>
      <p class="qa">Principle #2:<br />
        Walk Together</p>
      <p>Although Moses had his elders, it was Joshua whom he took with him to receive the tablets from God (Exodus 24:12-18). <strong><em>Emerging Leaders</em></strong> need to see the hand of God on their Senior Leaders. Emerging Leaders: much of what we will learn will not be by books or in conversation. Much of who we will become will be the direct result of what we &ldquo;SEE&rdquo; our Senior Leaders do. So, it is crucial that we walk along side our Senior Leaders to see who they really are. We must glean from their integrity, character, and anointing so we may one day walk as they do with God.</p>
      <p class="qa">Principle #3:<br />
        Entrust them with the Future</p>
      <p>Moses sent out his leaders to spy on the land, Joshua came back with a report of victory (Numbers 13:16-17). Senior Leaders should empower their Emerging Leaders to have a say in future endeavors of the ministry. If you have properly trained up your leaders they will ensure your future will be that of a great legacy. Emerging Leaders: you cannot focus on building your own kingdom. You must exist, as a leader, to serve the needs of others, especially the needs of &ldquo;the least of these&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="qa">Principle #4:<br />
        Release Publicly</p>
      <p>Moses publicly released the anointing over Joshua so the people would know he was called of God (Numbers 27:18-20). In a time of transition, it is vital for the people to identify where their leaders are leading them. It is also crucial for the people to know who will continue to lead them after the Senior Leaders have moved on. This is not an over night, wing-it kind of decision. Succession must be strategic, smooth, but above all God must ordain it. Joshua was a man who was being prepared throughout the entire ministry of Moses. He was not a novice. He was a man who led the people to war under the Mosaic leadership, as well as understood the significance of being in the presence of God. <strong><em>Senior Leaders:</em></strong> prepare your future leaders in the eyes of the people. The people will follow a leader who understands their needs and is willing to fight for them at any cost!!!</p>
      <p class="qa">Principle #5:<br />
        Do What Has Been Done</p>
      <p>Joshua was a great leader, yet he failed to reproduce what he had received from Moses (Judges 1:1; Judges 21:25). <strong><em>Emerging Leaders:</em></strong> do not forget where you have come from. It is unrighteous to despise the former leadership as if they have no value or no &ldquo;relevancy&rdquo; to what you are doing. It was in their leadership that you and I have been given the honor to lead others. Our Senior Leaders have paved the way for us; they are our pioneers and have paid a price that we have yet to pay. Likewise, we also will pay a price to break ground for a new generation, and one day we will become Senior Leaders. Be careful that what we despite now would not be who become to the next generation in the future.</p>
      <p>Finally, I believe we are in a season of great transition: one that is currently shaping our future in both the spirit and the natural realms. Because of this we as the body of Christ must ensure that our future leaders are men and women who can take the body to a new level that we have yet to experience. We cannot look at the past, our failure or successes. We have to believe God for a new move. One that still embodies the virtues of great moves such as holiness, consecration unto God, prayer, fasting, signs and wonders, and yet can be a testimony of God&rsquo;s power to both the believer and non-believer. It is in this kind of leadership that we are in need of. We have seen great moves of God, however I personally be&shy;lieve that His best is yet to come.</p>
      <p>To all leaders, I encourage you to continue in your efforts to establish His kingdom on earth, and to see our city transformed by His glory. Let us not grow weary in doing good nor faint in the midst of adversity. Fight for the Spirit of Unity to consume our lives as well as our ministry efforts. In doing so we will draw closer to His purposes of our city and those whom He desire for us to reach, the lost, the least of these...</p>
