      <p ><strong><em>Sometimes family knows best.</em></strong></p>
      <p>At home, I had just finished the final run-through of the solo for the Christmas Eve service, when the doorbell rang. My family swept in bearing armloads of Christmas gifts. Grandmother Johansson, whom we called &ldquo;Mormor,&rdquo; and my parents had come for Christmas Eve dinner. They planned to stay to hear me sing at the midnight candlelight service.</p>
            <div id="articlepic"><img src="images/santaGS.jpg" alt="Old grey photo of Santa" width="103" height="134"> </div>
      <p>After the service, I could scarely believe my ears when I heard my grandmother ask Jeff over for coffee. It was 2 am!</p>
      <p>After dinner, the man I&rsquo;d been halfheartly dating came by for coffee. I watched closely for my family&rsquo;s reactions. I was trying something new here. Typically I&rsquo;d gone for men I described as &ldquo;creative,&rdquo; &ldquo;unusual,&rdquo; or &ldquo;interesting&rdquo;. My family usually took one look and pronounced them &ldquo;weird.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>This fellow, however, was everything I was sure a grandmother would love. He looked clean-cut and handsome in a cashmere sweater. He spoke importantly about his-well-paying job and his recent ski trip to Utah. With a great flourish, he bestowed upon me expensive Christmas gifts: gold jewelry and a leather purse.</p>
      <p>Although my date had been a great fan of mine during the days before my conversion, when I sang in nightclubs, he was not interested in coming to hear me sing at church. After we&rsquo;d said good night and I shut the door behind, I turned to see my family assuming politely non-committal smiles. That summed up my own feelings.</p>
      <p><strong>Picking a winner</strong>. Dreams for a white Christmas came true that evening, and we drove to church in a  snowstorm. Once settled into the pew, I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder. I turned in surprise to see a musician I&rsquo;d recently met at another church.</p>
      <p>Everything about him stood out in contrast to the man whose company I&rsquo;d just left. His hair curled down to the collar of his flannel shirt. His manner was humble and polite, and he grinned, showing dimples you could get lost in. He said he&rsquo;d come to hear me sing.</p>
      <p>Even in the candlelight, Mormor was able to pick this one for a winner. The service ended, and before I knew it, she was shaking his hand. I could scarely believe my ears when I heard her ask him over for coffee. It was 2 am! She was 80 years old, and she and my parents had ahead of them a two-hour ride home in the snow.</p>
      <p>But Jeff wasted no time in accepting and somehow managed to arrive at my house in his battered old van well before we did. While waiting for us, he cleared a path through the snow to the front door. As he gave Mormor his arm to escort her into the house, I saw her smile widen.</p>
      <p>Mormor plied him with her ginger snaps and asked if he had plans for the next day. She invited him to her house for Christmas dinner.</p>
      <p>Things were quickly getting out of hand. I had no intention of making conversation for hours in the car with a virtual stranger on Christmas Day. Surely a man who came from a big happy family would have plans for Christmas Day. But &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I heard him say, &ldquo;nothing special is going on. I&rsquo;d love to come!&rdquo; By this Mormor&rsquo;s smile was 100 watts.</p>
      <p>As it happened, we did find plenty to talk about during those hours alone in the car. Our love for music and our love for God-the loves that would form the basis for our life together.</p>
      <p>My grandmother was wise enough to look at the heart of a man instead of his position. She read the kindness in his eyes, understood the meaning of his willingness to drive in a snowstorm at midnight to hear me sing, and appreciated the attitude of a servant who&rsquo;d hurried to clear a path through the snow.</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve long forgotten whatever sweater or perfume Mormor placed under the tree for me that year, but I will always be grateful that her vision and wisdom helped me to find my lifetime love.</p>
