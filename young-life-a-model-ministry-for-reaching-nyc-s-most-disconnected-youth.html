              <p>New York  City is known as the biggest metro&shy;polis with the brightest lights and greatest  op- portunity. Yet beyond the veneer, there are more than 2 million kids living  in the city under the age of 18 who aren&rsquo;t looking for their next career break,  but for deeper meaning and purpose. &ldquo;Most people don&rsquo;t realize that ma&shy;ny of  these kids are in crisis,&rdquo; says Paul Coty Young Life&rsquo;s Regional Director in New  York City. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing how many young people in this city are dealing with  circumstances most adults couldn&rsquo;t handle; but their stories typically get  swallowed up in the daily grind of the big city.&rdquo; Stories like Chenille&rsquo;s: a  teen mom without a stable place to live, who when learning of her pregnancy  fell despondent knowing she would surely have to drop out of school. Then there  is Wendell&mdash;a 17-year-old from Harlem and active gang member; he too would drop  out of school before seeing his brother nearly killed, bad&shy;ly beaten and left  in a coma by a rival gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years ago I remember standing on  the rooftop of a church saying there are millions of lost kids like Chenille  and Wendell&mdash;hopeless kids, fearful kids, kids who are confused and alone,&rdquo; says  Coty. &ldquo;I remember telling to God send us those kids and we will show up  wherever there is an opportunity to build healthy relationships with them.&rdquo; This  is where Young&rsquo;s Life (YL) model is at its best&mdash;a 70 year-old multicultural  mini&shy;s&shy;try that focuses on youth living in  economically-depress- &shy;ed communities. For Young Life, great uncertainty  is the greatest opportunity to share the message of God&rsquo;s love with young  people in need of purpose and direction. Young  Life is arguably the largest ministry of its kind in the United States and since 2000 has been  expanding its presence in the city with purpose--growing from 3 staff members  to over 30 and more than 100 volunteers.</p>
<p>Young Life&rsquo;s  work begins with placing a caring adult leader in a  community-district who will work collaboratively with local residents to create  a model ministry for that specific neighborhood. The components of that mo&shy;del  are simple yet effective: a coalition of people praying, volunteers coordinated  to perform contact work and outreach, an organized committee of adults  providing strategic support, and groups of  kids engaged through YL camps, campaigners, and clubs. It&rsquo;s through the latter  where Chenille and Wendell met their local Young Life leaders; individuals who  invested time to build genuine relationships with each troubled teen and in the  process earned the right to share an eternal hope that would eventually become their own.</p>
<p>Today Chenille is an active Young Life  participant who says the program gave her a new outlook on life. &ldquo;I began to  see my pregnancy didn&rsquo;t mean things were over &mdash;instead I began to see my  daughter&rsquo;s birth as a new beginning.&rdquo; For Wendell, his Young Life experience impacted him so profoundly that he eventually  became a Young Life Leader in his own community  of Harlem. &ldquo;Young Life helped me get back into school and now I know there's something  more for me out there, and that every day I can be doing better; building  and growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you would like to join a committee,  serve as a volunteer, or become a Young Life Leader in your neighborhood,  contact Paul Coty, YLNYC Regional Director at 917.435.7843 or visit http://  younginlife.nyc for more information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Young Life is a worldwide organization  for middle school, high school and college students. Founded in 1941, Young  Life is active in more than 90 countries reaching nearly 1.7 million kids  annually. Young Life NYC operates local ministries in 19 of the 59 community-districts  across the five boroughs serving 8,000 youth annually.</em></strong></p>
