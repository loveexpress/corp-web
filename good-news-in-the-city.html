              <p><strong>Evangelist Luis Palau</strong>, whose ministry is based in Portland, Oregon, has revealed that he and his wife will  be moving temporarily to New York City ahead of a massive, and likely  historical, evangelistic and celebratory event taking place this summer at the  Big Apple's iconic Central Park.</p>
              <p>&quot;Pat and I are moving to New York  City! Please pray! We won't be there for good. Just through the summer ...  until the evangelistic festival in Central Park on July 11. It's a big move  with a lot of details to iron out,&quot; reads a statement from Palau's  organization that was emailed to supporters this past weekend. &quot;The  opportunities for presenting the Gospel in NYC are many and seem to come in a  flash. The team decided it would be best to respond to the invitations if Pat  and I were living in the city, available at a moment's notice.&quot;</p>
              <p>Palau has personally preached the Gospel to more than 30 million  people all over the world since becoming a missionary with his wife in 1962,  but the popular evangelist has never preach&shy;ed in NYC on such a grand stage.  When he takes to the Great Lawn this summer, the 80-year-old Argentinian, known  for his simple and accented Gospel presentation and precise wit, will have  joined the ranks of other influential Christian leaders who have preached to  the masses at Central Park.</p>
              <p>Pope John Paul II and evangelist Billy  Graham both held worship services on the 55-acre open lawn, in 1995 and in  1991, respectively. The New York Times repor&shy;ted that then-72-year-old Graham's  &quot;crusade of love and redemption&quot; was atten&shy;ded by an estimated 250,000 people, while the pope, 75 at the time,  welcomed &quot;a chanting, cheering, joyously sing&shy;ing biblical multitude&quot; of more than 125,000 to Mass on the  Great Lawn.</p>
              <p>For his part, an estima&shy;ted 60,000  people were expected to join Palau on the Great Lawn in July, along with several recording artists, for the event  called NY CityFest. The seasoned evangelist shared at a missions conference in  2013 that he believed God had gi&shy;ven him a dream about preaching the Gospel in  New York City, after he had listened to a Billy Graham crusade in 1959.</p>
              <p>Palau seemed most grateful to local  Christians and partners for helping to realize his dream about preaching to the  masses in NYC.</p>
              <p>&quot;To be able to gather together in unity,  in one of the most iconic locations in the world, and give this gift to the  city &mdash;it's a privilege. And it wouldn't have been possible without the hard  work of hundreds of churches and thousands of individuals right here in NYC and  around the nation,&quot; Palau told The Christian Post in an emailed statement  on Monday.</p>
              <p>The evangelist  also gave special credit to minori&shy;ty Christians who have lent their support to NY CityServe, the good  works compliment of NY CityFest: &quot;Seeing the minorities step up and lead  the way in this effort has been one of the greatest thrills for me. Many of  them see this as their opportunity to bless the city and nation that has given  them so much. And now, to be able to work together to proclaim 'Good News in  the City' &mdash; what a joy!&quot;</p>
              <p>Palau also expressed the desire that NY  CityFest would be an event to remember.  &quot;It is my prayer and expectation that many people will look back on this  effort years from now and see how God used this time of their unity and service to do something special in  the lives of so many people in NYC,&quot; he said.</p>
              <p>Several guests will be on stage before  Palau presents his &quot;message about the transformative  power of hope&quot; to the masses in July. Re&shy;cording artists <strong>TobyMac</strong>, <strong>Israel</strong> <strong>Houghton</strong>, <strong>Matt</strong> <strong>Red&shy;- man</strong>, <strong>Mandisa</strong>, <strong>Hezekiah</strong> <strong>Walker</strong>, <strong>Marcos</strong> <strong>Witt</strong>, and <strong>Rescate</strong> were just some of the guests expected. Retired New York  Yankees pitcher <strong>Mariano</strong> <strong>Ri&shy;vera</strong>, whose wife pastors a local  church, was also expected to attend. Journalist <strong>Myrka</strong> <strong>Dellanos</strong> is listed  as the emcee for the event, which is expected to run from 4pm-10pm. Those  unable to attend NY CityFest in person will be able to listen in or watch via  radio, te&shy;le&shy;vision and live&shy;streaming.</p>
