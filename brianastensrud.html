            </div>
      <p >What do nearly four million women have in common? <strong>Women of Faith.</strong></p>
      <p>Dallas-based <strong>Women of Faith</strong> is America&rsquo;s largest women&rsquo;s conference and on <strong>June 20-21, 2008</strong>, thousands of women will gather at the IZOD Center for the 2008 Infinite Grace conference! Each year Women of Faith hosts as many as 30 conferences, selling out arenas all over the country from the Honda Center in Anaheim to the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>2008 marks a new season for Women of Faith as it enters its 13th year stronger than ever. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;This year we had several sold out conferences before the season even started,&rdquo; said Mary Graham, president of Women of Faith conferences. &ldquo;The response from our attendees has been so overwhelming and exciting.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>As Women of Faith starts another year many are asking: what is it about Women of Faith that draws so many women - and why do they keep coming back? Perhaps it&rsquo;s the community of belonging these women feel when they arrive.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relief to walk into the Women of Faith arena and feel I&rsquo;m not alone, that the stress I face on a daily basis, whether it be at work or in the home, is not uncommon to most women around me,&rdquo; said Lynda Parker, a Las Vegas Women of Faith attendee.</p>
      <p>Maybe women flock to the conference to find relief and encouragement for the unique burdens they encounter as women.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Most women are overworked, overextended and underappreciated,&rdquo; said Graham. &ldquo;Our conferences are a time where women can enjoy a weekend away with their girlfriends from whatever causes them stress.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Possibly it&rsquo;s the message of real faith and friendship these women hear. Through tears and laughter, the Women of Faith core speakers and guest artists share messages of hope and encouragement with women all over the country. These speakers work as a team seven months of the year, but still remain close companions in the &ldquo;off-season.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>These core speakers: Sheila Walsh, Marilyn Meberg, Patsy Clairmont, and Luci Swindoll, Sandi Patty, Nichole Johnson, Anita Renfroe and Nicole C. Mullen bring their message home in authentic ways, baring their souls to arenas full of women all over the country.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I had heard about the conferences for several years and my church usually sent a large group each year, but I had resisted because I thought it would be too &lsquo;prissy&rsquo; for me,&rdquo; said Marcia Stanley, an attendee from Haverhill, MA. &ldquo;Boy was I wrong. The speakers, I learned, were women of grit, integrity and edgy hu&shy;mor. Real women I could relate to, not country club types with no clue about the deep tough stuff of life.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>What exactly do the speakers share at the conferences that make such an impact on the lives of millions of women? The Women of Faith speakers share their lives &ndash; their hurts, struggles and joys &ndash; and women identify with them.</p>
      <p>At the conference women will hear the message of singer/songwriter Sheila Walsh, a former host of The 700 Club, who speaks openly and candidly about her battle with depression.</p>
      <p>Marilyn Meberg, though she suffered through the death of her husband and her daughter&rsquo;s rape, has never detoured from the ultimate message that a woman can live in the ashes of pain and loss.</p>
      <p>Although humor is her strong suit now, Patsy Clairmont shares her battle with agoraphobia, exposing the all-too-familiar fear women feel.</p>
      <p>Luci Swindoll, a former Mobil Company executive and opera singer who has visited seven continents at her current age of 73, shows women how to add a little adventure in life.</p>
      <p>The most awarded female vocalist in contemporary Christian music, Sandi Patty, openly shares her struggles as well. Sandi&rsquo;s coped with issues ranging from a poor body image to worries about past mistakes.</p>
      <p>And finally, Anita Renfroe is the weekend comedian, making every women realize how great it is to laugh out loud. You might have recently heard about her, as she is a regular guest on Good Morning America, and had over 8 million hits on her YouTube William Tell All-MomSense song.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there isn&rsquo;t one simple answer as to why women have continued to come to Women of Faith over the past 12 years. Whether or not their reasons for coming are the same, nearly four million women share one thing in common &ndash; they have all experienced Women of Faith and for many of them life will never be the same.</p>
      <p>As Women of Faith starts 2008 with their Infinite Grace conference, one thing is certain &ndash; things aren&rsquo;t slowing down anytime soon! This year, Women of Faith will host 30 conferences across the country.</p>
      <p><strong>Women of Faith&rsquo;s 2008 Infinite Grace</strong> conference will be in East Rutherford, NJ at the IZOD Center on <strong>June 20-21, 2008</strong>. The conference will feature YouTube sensation &amp; William Tell/MomSense comedian <strong>Anita Renfroe</strong>, musi cal artists <strong>Natalie Grant</strong> &amp; <strong>Nicole C. Mullen</strong>, dramatist <strong>Nichole Johnson</strong> and impressionist <strong>Louise DuArt</strong>. On <strong>Friday, June 20th</strong> the pre-conference will begin at <strong>10am</strong> and end at <strong>3pm</strong>. The main conference will start on Friday evening at <strong>7pm</strong> and end at <strong>10pm</strong> continuing on <strong>Saturday, June 21st</strong> from <strong>9am-5pm</strong>.</p>
