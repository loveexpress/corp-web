 <p >New  York City was the epicenter of the most important re&shy;ligious revivals of the  19th century. The Businessmen&rsquo;s Revival, as it is often cal&shy;led, began on  Sep&shy;t. 23, 1857 in North Dutch Re&shy;formed Church on the corner of Ful&shy;ton and  William Streets in the lower Man&shy;hattan. It began with a mid-day prayer service  at&shy;tended by businessmen working in the financial district and grew to a  citywide pheno&shy;menon. From New York the revival quickly spread to other cities  as well, eventually helping to redefine the religious landscape of the nation.</p>
            <div class="imgdrop" id="articlepic2"><img src="images/jeremiahclamphier.jpg" alt="Jeremiah C. Lanphier" width="96" height="136"></div>
              <p><strong>Jeremiah C. Lanphi&shy;er</strong> was  by all accounts an un&shy;likely candidate to start a national revival. A  businessman himself, he had been converted some years before in the Broadway  Tabernacle that had been founded by Charles Finney (himself one of the great  re&shy;vivalists of US&#8200;history). Lanphier had begun working as a lay outreach  minister for the Fulton Street Re&shy;formed Church. The na&shy;tion&rsquo;s cities were  rapidly growing in the 1850s and business was booming. But church membership  had be&shy;gun to dwindle. Lanphier noted that many of the businessmen who came  into the lower Manhattan neighborhood every day had only re&shy;cently arrived in  the city, and were often without a church home.</p>
              <p>Thus  he decided to an&shy;nounce a mid-day prayer service at the Fulton Street Church.  The first day he opened up the third floor and sat for the first 30 minutes  alone. Around 12:30 one, then two, then several more businessmen made their way  up the stairs, until a total of six had gathered for prayer. The following week  he opened the church again and twenty came in. The third week forty attended.  Lanphier began holding daily services from 12 to 1pm for prayer, moving the  meeting to the second floor where a larger room could accommodate the rapidly  growing numbers.</p>
              <p>Word  of the revival spread quickly. The financial collapse of the markets and a run  on the banks that October that resulted in the Panic of 1857 helped fuel the  turn to prayer. In Fe&shy;bruary the YMCA, which had only arrived in New York City  several years be&shy;fore, began organizing similar mid-day prayer services for  businessmen in other churches, including the John Street Methodist Epis&shy;copal  Church. The Metho&shy;dists soon had a band known as the Flying Ar&shy;til&shy;le&shy;ry of  Heaven visiting their churches throughout the city to spread the re&shy;vi&shy;val.</p>
              <p>In  Brooklyn, Ply&shy;mouth Congregational Church be&shy;gan to overflow with the businessmen  coming in each day for prayer. Henry Ward Beecher, the well-known pastor of the  church, was joined for a time by his equally famous sister, Har&shy;riet Beecher  Stowe, in leading these services in 1858. The YMCA rented Bur&shy;ton&rsquo;s Theater in  lower Manhattan for several weeks of services. News&shy;papers such as the Herald  and the Tribune be&shy;gan running stories on the revival during the spring of  1858. Horace Greeley, editor of the Tribune, took a particular interest in the  course that events were taking.</p>
              <p>Among  the most im&shy;portant long term effects of the Revival were the in&shy;di&shy;vi&shy;duals  who were affected by it. Arthur Tappan Pier&shy;son, one of the great names in 19th  century missions and a successful (if sometimes controversial)&#8200;urban  pastor, was a student at Union Theo&shy;lo&shy;gi&shy;cal Se&shy;mi&shy;nary (then located in lower  Man&shy;hat&shy;tan)&#8200;and was teaching a Bi&shy;ble class at Thir&shy;teenth Street  Pres&shy;by&shy;terian Church during the Revival. His life was de&shy;finitely shaped by  its im&shy;pact. Dwight L. Moody was only 21 and living in Chi&shy;ca&shy;go during the  Revival of 1857-1858, but no one learned more than he the lessons of bringing  religion to the downtown business district and involving successful business  leaders at every stage.</p>
              <p>Eventually  the fires of the Businessmen&rsquo;s Revival in New York died down, but when it was  over the city&rsquo;s religious landscape was dramatically changed. One of the most  obvious results was the dramatic rise in church membership in all  denominations. Es&shy;ti&shy;mates run as high as 50,000 new members joining chur&shy;ches  in the city as a result of the awakening. Second, the re&shy;vival of 1857-1858 was  in large part lay-led, and geared toward the business community, not only in  NYC but through&shy;out the nation. It was the first such revival to be so in US  church history, the first such effort to take spirituality into the business  world in such an ex&shy;plicit manner.</p>
