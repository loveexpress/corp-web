              <p class="qa">My  Journey of Prayer</p>
              
              <p>About 2  years in the making of <strong>The Love Express</strong>,  the Lord spoke to me, and gave clear direction concerning <strong>The Love Express</strong>. He told me it would  be, and always re&shy;main a clearing house of what the Holy Spirit would be  doing in the Christian Community.</p>
              <p>It was  different doing the paper. It would be a means of commitment with rough roads to climb over. Many churches said,  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and closed their doors, but I knew that this wonsetas God&rsquo;s agenda, God&rsquo;s  newspaper. I died to my flesh, picked myself up, and with the help of the Holy  Spirit, here we are 26 years later. From the  it was hard getting information from churches about  what was happening in their churches and ministries.</p>
              <p>Thank God, there are plenty of  activities listed in <strong>The Love Express</strong> where you can take your children. Whatever is your cup of tea, whether Baptist,  Lutheran, Charismatic, etc., that&rsquo;s what makes <strong>The Love Express </strong>unique. Thank God&nbsp;  for chur&shy;ches and ministries that are coming to the rescue, and  providing activities.</p>
              <p> <strong>The</strong> <strong>Love</strong> <strong>Express</strong> has been serving the Body of Christ for 26 years. Our first  paper was eight pages which came out in  Septem&shy;ber of 1985. Throughout these years, you the readers have been right  there with us. We have strived to build relationships with pastors, and build  bridges over the many obstacles that hold the  Body of Christ back from true unity. <strong>Prayer  has al&shy;ways been the underlying foundation of all that we do.</strong> We pray when  our computers don&rsquo;t function properly, pray for our distributors and families,  pray for advertisers, pastors and churches that receive <strong>The Love Ex&shy;press</strong>, pray for our printing company, and pray for the  fi&shy;nances of The Love Ex&shy;press.</p>
              <p> <strong>The  Love Express</strong> has been reporting the &lsquo;Good News&rsquo; for over 26 years in the  tri-state area and I know the paper has been a blessing to you. Churches, mini&shy;s&shy;tries,  writers, business peo- ple, singers, have all said how much the paper is needed.</p>
              <p>I realize that I am really inadequate to  completely fulfill the task God has set before me, but I&rsquo;ve learned to rest in  Him to run the largest &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; newspaper in the Tri-state area. Sometimes  the juggling of the work of the ministry, and the newspaper at the same time,  is so staggering, so immense, that if I were to sit down and think about it, I  would be completely overwhelmed. <strong>So what makes me keep going to face the numerous  obstacles that are before me? It&rsquo;s knowing  that my God is with me in my prayers, praise and worship</strong>. These are  my food: my substance. God has enabled  me through supernatural power to fulfill this calling on my life. <strong>Be en&shy;couraged</strong>.<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Without  prayer</strong>, we don&rsquo;t have a ministry. <strong>With&shy;out prayer</strong>, we are not servants of the most high God. <strong>Without prayer</strong>, we will ne&shy;ver discover the secret place with the Lord.</p>
              <p>Never get so busy that you have no time  for prayer.</p>
              <p>I can remember as if it was yesterday  the first ever <strong>Love Express</strong> hot off  the press. It was an exciting time. I  walked by blind faith. I saw the body of <strong>Christ</strong> as one, functioning as one unit, working  today as one body. It was scary to venture out of your protective garden (or religious circles) to meet and greet Pastors.</p>
              <p>Many Pastors  I&rsquo;ve heard about, but I never had the opportunity to visit their ser&shy;vice. <strong>Why are we so afraid, so uncomfortable  of the unknown.</strong></p>
              <p>I guess you can read between the lines  the Lord was doing a mighty work in my heart.  In God&rsquo;s eyes I was ready for my destiny yet in my mind I was not ready.</p>
              <p>Unity, the  Father&rsquo;s heart cries, that we all be one in his son <strong>Jesus Christ</strong>. In spite of  our differences in mi&shy;nistering the word of <strong>Christ, &ldquo;We Are One&rdquo;</strong> and the Lord desires that the world see us as  one in Him.</p>
              <p>Working on <strong>The Love Express </strong>has taught me much about patience, love and  forgiveness, and how <strong>we are not to love  and cry unity, when we pick and choose those ministries or ministers that  reflect our likes and taste, that is not God&rsquo;s unity.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>&ldquo;WE&#8200;ARE&#8200;ONE&rdquo;not </strong><strong>because we are the same color, or because we speak at the same meet&shy;ings,  &ldquo;WE&#8200;ARE&#8200;ONE&rdquo;&#8200;be&shy;cause of our love of Je&shy;sus Christ.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><em> </em></strong>In the  month of Jan&shy;ua&shy;ry many churches and mini&shy;s&shy;tries are planning to fast and seek  the Lord for 10, 20, 30 and even 40 days. Plan to join your church for a time  of corporate fasting and pra&shy;yer. Fasting is an act of de&shy;nying yourself and  placing God back where He always belongs, in the center of our lives, our  families, churches businesses and nation. If you never fasted, start slow&shy;ly,  if you are under a doctor&rsquo;s care, ask your doctor whether you&rsquo;re able to fast.</p>
              <p> <strong>Why  fast? </strong>Fasting blesses every area of our mental, spiritual and emotional  life. It breaks habits and strongholds in our life that we aren&rsquo;t aware of.  Start slowly and each day begin with prayer; read Isa&shy;iah 58 where it states <strong>&ldquo;Is this not the fast I have chosen...,&rdquo;</strong> list those areas of your life that needs to be set free, and begin to fast.</p>
              <p>I remember when I first heard about fasting; the first thing I did  was to gather scripture pertaining to fasting; I read about sanctifying  yourself and turning your heart over to the Lord. I must admit it was not easy;  the flesh had such a hold on me, but I kept prevailing, and now after 30 years  it has become a way of life. Fasting cannot be  done without prayer. Find a place to get alone with God, confess your faults  to Him, pray and wait before Him. It is important  at this time that the Body of Christ come to&shy;gether with fasting and pra&shy;yer  and wait on Him. Is there any good reason why  not to fast. If you fail, start all over again.</p>
              <p> <strong>PRAYER </strong>is the backbone of the ministry. God&rsquo;s restoring prayer to our rea&shy;ders,  churches and minis&shy;tries.</p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Types of Fasts</strong></p>
              <p>There are  several types of fasting. The one you choose is between you and God. He will honor your best sacrifice.</p>
              <p><strong>Full Fast:</strong> Drink  only liquids (you establish the number of days).</p>
              <p><strong>The Daniel Fast:</strong> Eat no  meat, no sweets and no bread. Drink water and  juice. Eat fruits and vegetables.</p>
              <p><strong>3-Day Fast:</strong> This fast can be a Full Fast, Daniel Fast or  give up at least one item of food.</p>
              <p><strong>Partial Fast:</strong> A  partial fast is from 6am-3pm or from sun up to  sundown. You can select from three types of fasting-a Full Fast, Daniel  Fast or give up at least one item of food.</p>
              <p><strong>Scripture References for Fasting:</strong> Matthew  6:16-18, Matthew 9:14-15, Luke 18: 9-14.</p>
              <p><strong>Relation to Prayer &amp;  Reading of the Word:</strong> 1 Samuel  1:6-8, 17-18, Ne&shy;hemiah 1:4, Daniel 9:3, 20, Joel 2:12, Luke 2: 37, Acts  10-:30, Acts 13:2.</p>
              <p>Corporate  Fasting: 1 Sa&shy;mu&shy;el 7:5-6, Ezra 8:21-23, Nehemiah 9:1-3, Joel 2:15-16, Jonah 3:  5-10, Acts 27:33-37.</p>
              <p>Remember that it is the attitude of a  heart sincerely seeking Him to which God responds with a blessing (Isaiah 58,  Jeremiah 14:12, 1 Corinthians 8:8). May God greatly  bless you as you fast!</p>
              <p><strong>PS. Check with your doctor if you are on  medication before you go on the fast.</strong></p>
              <p align="center"><strong>How to Begin Fasting</strong></p>
              <p>If you have  never fasted before, do not start off with a 40-day fast unless  you are very sure God has called you to do this. The body grows accustomed to  fasting by degrees, and God does not usually ask us to run before we have begun  to walk. Start with a partial fast, or fast one day until supper. The next  time, extend the fast till retiring, breaking it with a light meal or fruit.</p>
              <p>When you can manage on a one-day fast  without feeling faint or famished (not without feeling hungry!), you will be  ready for the call of God to a longer fast. But the longer the fast, the more certain you need to be that God has  called you to it.</p>
              <p>Beware of being carried away by carnal  enthusiasm. &ldquo;Keep back thy servant from  presumptuous sins&rdquo; (Ps 19:13, KJV) must be your constant prayer.  Remember that asceticism may be as much &ldquo;of the flesh&rdquo; as over&shy;indulgence; the latter is a sin of the body, the former  of the spirit.</p>
              <p>If the fast is to be for some days,  there is a temptation as it approaches to overindulge. Better far to bend our  wills in advance to the battle of self discipline; it will ease the later  conflict.</p>
              <p>Finally, it is of supreme importance to approach this spiritual  exercise as a fast of God&rsquo;s choosing. It may help to ask yourself the following  questions.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>1. Am I confident that this </strong><strong>desire is God given?</strong> Would He have me undertake a normal  or just a partial fast? &ldquo;Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert&rdquo; (Mt. 4:1)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>2. Are  my motives right?</strong> Is there any hidden desire to impress others? &ldquo;Your  Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.&rdquo; (Mt. 6:4)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>3. What  are my spiritual objectives in this fast?</strong> Personal consecration? In&shy;tercession?  Special burdens? Revival? &ldquo;I press on toward  the goal.&rdquo; (Phil. 3:14).</p>
              <p><strong>4. Are  my objectives self-centered?</strong> Is my desire for personal  blessing balanced by genuine concern for others? &ldquo;Each of you should look not  only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.&rdquo; (Phil. 2:4</p>
              <p>&nbsp;<strong>5. Am I  determined above all else to minister to the Lord in this fast?</strong> &ldquo;They were  worshipping the Lord and fasting&rdquo; (Acts 13:2).</p>
              <p>You should  expect fasting to be, as it was for your Master, a time of conflict with the powers of  darkness. Sa&shy;tan will often try to take advantage of your physical condition to  launch an attack. Discouragement is one of  his weapons. Guard against it by maintaining a spirit of praise.</p>
              <p>Read through Ephe&shy;sians 6 and avail  yourself of the whole armor of God. Make use of the shield of faith to quench  all Satan&rsquo;s flaming darts. In hand-to-hand encounter, use the sword of the  Spirit, and tell Satan, &ldquo;It is written...&rdquo; De&shy;clare  the victory of your great Captain over every principality and power.</p>
              <p>Do not judge the efficacy of your intercessions  by what you feel. Often in pra&shy;yer and fasting you will find the going harder  instead of easier. This is often when most is happening. This is wrestling.  This is heavenly warfare. Your Captain  did not promise a walk&shy;over but a fight, and  He gave you the weapons to win. Often you will not see the results until  later, but the promise stands: &ldquo;Your Father, who sees what is done in secret,  will reward you.&rdquo; (Mt. 6:4).</p>
              <p>From  strength to strength go on, Wrestle, and fight, and pray; Tread all the powers  of darkness down, And win the well-fought day.</p>
              <p align="right"><strong>- Charles Wesley</strong></p>
              <p class="qa">We Have a Mandate to Pray and Fast.</p>
              <p><strong>Seek God on behalf of:</strong> Youth,  Children, Men, Wo&shy;men, Families, Pastors, Homeless people, the poor, the  military, school teachers, our neighbors, the secular media, marriages, singles  persons, immigrants, unborn babies,  businesses, universities students, prisoners and their families, government  leaders, the President, unemployed people, athletes, Holly&shy;wood, the Arts and  Enter&shy;tainment, alcoholics, drug addicts, broken families, the next generation, church unity, elderly folks,  repentance, nations of the world, Israel, United States of America and the list  goes on and on.</p>
              <p>In the last 4 or more years I sense that  the community of churches has seen, heard and  even gone through events in the life, but they have made a commitment to  Jesus Christ. <strong>What is that commitment? TO FAST and PRAY.</strong></p>
              <p class="articlecredits"><strong>But nothing God is go&shy;ing to do will happen without PRAYER.</strong></p>
