            <h4 id="articleTitle">Youth Seemingly Born Ahead of Their Time with Fire in Their Bones are Now Being Released into the Marketplaces</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>              by Bill Yount</p>
            </div>
      <p class="articlecredits" >Psalm 127:4, 5 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth...they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</p>
      <p>I was sitting on the passenger side of our car as my son, eighteen years of age, was driving home from school. He was speaking about his small business of &quot;media promotions&quot; when all of a sudden, I experienced like a raging fire burning inside of me that I have never felt in my whole life. I said to the Lord, &quot;What is this fire that is burning me up on the inside as though it would consume me?&quot; </p>
      <p>I sensed the Lord saying, &quot;I am allowing you to feel your son's passion to promote businesses that is burning like a wild fire inside of his bones. He represents a generation who will be used like no other generation in the marketplaces of the earth! My fire inside of this chosen generation is burning up every mold and every boundary of limitation that has been ingrained in them by this present world. I can only allow you to experience a small flickering of the flame of that fire, for any more would literally consume you!&quot;<br />
      </p>
      <p class="qa">&quot;I Will Give Them Wisdom and Knowledge Beyond the Elite of this Present Generation!&quot;</p>
      <p class="articlecredits">Psalm 119:98-100 (paraphrased) Lord, through Thy commandments, You have made me wiser than my enemies: for they are ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers; for Thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients, because I keep Thy precepts.</p>
      <p>I sensed the Lord saying, &quot;My fire is burning up the molds of generational thought patterns that have told them, 'You must do it this way or that way.' I am going to use them in unusual, unique ways like no other generation. I will scatter them into the highways and byways and marketplaces of the earth. I will give them wisdom and knowledge beyond the elite of this present age. I will use them to break open the fountain of wisdom of <strong>witty inventions and things not yet created</strong>. Some will begin to lead leaders of this present generation at a young age in the fields of technology and industry.&quot;</p>
      <p class="qa">&quot;They Will Be Used as 'Battering Rams' to Break Down the Walls Between the Older and Younger Generations&quot;</p>
      <p>These young firebrands will seem to have the blood of both the younger and older generation mixed in their DNA. Their zeal of child-like faith and simplicity will produce a refiring in the older generation, while their ancient wisdom will infuse spiritual stability and maturity into the younger generation. This will act as a cohesive agent igniting love and understanding, bringing both generations together in unity. This younger generation will begin to see visions of older peoples' dreams and will help their dreams come true.</p>
      <p>Recently, my great nephew, who is twenty-one, went with me on a ministry trip to two churches. I thought I would let him get his feet wet since he has never shared his testimony outside of the little church he attends. As he stood up and began to share a five minute testimony, his countenance shone as the glory of the Lord came upon him. He shared how he had been raised in a terribly dysfunctional family, yet was influenced by praying grandparents. God had kept him and used the brokenness and struggles he endured to create the fire of God he now carried. An anointing of deliverance fell like lightning upon the people, breaking whole families free from their bondages and prisons. It seemed that that whole church had families who were struggling with loved ones in bondage to sin. Since my nephew was an overcomer, his prayer carried the key of God's power to unlock the prison doors for many of those families, setting them free.</p>
      <p class="qa">Parents and Grandparents Must Release the Younger Generation...The Lord Has Need of Them!</p>
      <p>Don't expect your children and grandchildren to be used the way God has used you. There is already one of you. The Lord loves variety. Many children right now are not even aware of the call of God on their lives. But as they follow their burning passion that God has placed inside of them, they will discover God and His favor upon them. Many will be catapulted into renowned, strategic positions to take dominion over the kingdoms of this world to become the Kingdoms of our God. Release your children and let them go free!</p>
