            </h4>
              <div id="authorname">by Jay Fordice

              <p><strong>It started with one small group of Latino  leaders and a simple invitation. They were eager to have Luis Palau and his  team help lead an evangelistic effort reaching  the Tri-State area. Within a few more meetings, the group of interested  leaders grew exponentially spanning all five boroughs along with parts of New  Jersey, Connecticut, and Long Island.</strong></p>
              <p>At the same time, Kevin Palau, LPA&rsquo;s  President, took part in ongoing discussions with leaders in New York Ci&shy;ty.  They discussed ways to accelerate the ongoing Gos&shy;pel Movement that was already  underway.</p>
              <p>Their vision? To see a greater level of  unity,colla&shy;boration, and partnership among churches and Gospel or  organizations while incorporating service, prayer, church planting, and  evangelism.</p>
              <p>By God&rsquo;s grace, and the prompting of  several local leaders, these two streams came together. Latino, An&shy;glo, Korean,  Caribbean, and African-American leaders actively  considered ways to bring their ideas together  and unite in one large-scale effort. With that, NY CityServe &amp;  CityFest was born. </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>God is on the Move in New York City</strong></p>
              <p>There is a movement underway in NYC. It  has gained traction and produced enduring results. Because of this movement,  Church planting has become a major priority, with 100 new church plants in  Manhattan alone!</p>
              <p>Other healthy signs of this Gospel  Movement continue to reveal God&rsquo;s work in NYC.  For instance, the evangelical population is growing in the urban core. This is due, in part, to  millions of new immigrants who are bringing a strong Christian faith to the city. Collaboration among denominations and  ethnic groups is also growing in strength and participation. As a result, civic  and corporate leaders are working with churches to actively build bridges of  cooperation in their communities, renewing their commitment to service in  unprecedented ways.</p>
              <p>Much groundwork has already been laid in  prayer, faith, and service. Today, New York&rsquo;s spiritual environment is ripe for  a new movement of God&rsquo;s people. And many see NY CityServe &amp; CityFest as the  catalyst. Elements of the Campaign include:</p>
              <p><em>NY CityServe</em> &mdash;A  long-term, citywide movement that identifies,  develops, and nurtures kingdom collaborations around the areas of justice,  mercy, and education throughout the Tri-State  area. These church-connected, neighborhood-focused ser&shy;vice initiatives  will mobilize thousands of individuals and accelerate  the impact of what God is doing. We&rsquo;re excited to have the leadership of  Chris Troy (Director of NY CityServe), Robert Guerrero (Redeemer City to City)  and Althea Taylor (Bronx Betha&shy;ny Church of the Nazarene) overseeing this  long-term vision.</p>
              <p><em>Regional Outreaches</em> &mdash; A  three-month-long evangelistic initiative focused on saturating the Tri-State  area with the Good News of Jesus Christ. Including more than 150 evangelistic  gatherings, every borough, region, and neighborhood will have the opportunity  to prepare and plan their own localized outreaches, large and small. Luis  Palau, Andrew Palau, and other partner evangelists will be available to help  share the Good News at each event. </p>
              <p><em>CityFest with Luis Palau</em> &mdash; A  free, multicultural festival (in Spanish and English) in June/July 2015. This  fun, family friendly festival will be focused on worship, clear Gospel  proclamation, and celebrating the work accomplished through CityServe. </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>Imagine the Impact</strong></p>
              <p>Hundreds of churches and nonprofits from  across the New York City metro area are  already coming together to love and serve their area&rsquo;s in a historic and sustainable  way. Imagine what will be accomplished  as we help them to increase collaboration among civic, corporate, and church  leaders, which span across ethnic, economic,  and denominational lines.</p>
              <p>LPA is helping to establish sustainable partnerships, unique to each  borough, region, and neighborhood, as we push toward greater levels of action  and community involvement for the greater good of their region. Imagine all the  regional and neighborhood efforts to share the Good News through multiple  evangelistic gatherings, and culminating in one large multicultural  evangelistic festival in the heart of the city with world evangelist Luis  Palau. Just think thousands of lives, families, and communities can be  transformed by the power of the Gospel.</p>
              <p>This is the vision of the New York City  Initiative...and your opportunity to change lives for eternity...in the most  influential city in the world. </p>
              <p align="center"><strong>A City of Influence</strong></p>
              <p>New York City is among the most  influential cities in the world. History has shown that great spiritual and  social movements birthed in New York City have long-term influence on the rest  of the nation and the world.</p>
              <p>NY CityServe  &amp; CityFest is our opportunity to energize the Christian  community, lift up the name of Jesus Christ, and mobilize tens of thousands of  individuals to serve the city and proclaim the Good News. LPA will help  hundreds of local churches as they demonstrate Christ&rsquo;s unconditional love and  compassion for the city through an ongoing, sustained Gos&shy;pel Movement.</p>
