      <p >As a child I dreamed of singing and dancing on stage. I would move the furniture out of our living room, turn the record player up as loud as it could go and perform for anyone who came through the door. But back in Richmond, Virginia where I was raised in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s we didn&rsquo;t have any performance arts schools and my family could not afford to send me to special classes, so all I could do was dream. At age 19, while on summer break at Virginia State University, I visited a cousin in New York City and my life forever took a change. A friend enrolled me into my first dance class; the late Rosetta LeNoire hired me at the AMAS Repertory Theater and I never went back home. This was my dream, this was my destiny and this was what God created me to do. Within six months I had my Actors Equity Association union card and I was a working New York gypsy. That wasn&rsquo;t the end of it. God had even more plans for me. Three years later Michael Bennett hired me for a workshop. There I met Ben Harney who introduced me to Jesus Christ as my personal Savior. That same year the workshop opened on Broadway as Dreamgirls, Ben won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical and my life changed again forever.</p>
            <div id="articlepic">
              <img src="images/childrenofgod.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="186" />            </div>
      <p>My ambitions and aspirations began to shift. I was probably the most myopic, selfish Christian on the planet but God refused to allow me to stay that way. I began to turn down roles and good paying jobs to be involved in ministry and missions. For a while I thought that all show business was of the devil and hid in my safe little spiritual bubble denying my desires and trying to cast out the very thing that God had created in me. My Creativity was screaming to be released. My character was going through so many changes that for a while I didn&rsquo;t even recognize myself. I was being transformed but at the time it felt more like punishment or torture. Death would have been easy if I&rsquo;d had only been allowed to die while it was happening. But I was being called to be a living sacrifice while God renewed my mind.</p>
      <p>Now I&rsquo;m living my dream but far more abundantly than I ever dreamed possible. My destiny included responsibilities (like Joseph) that as a youngster I was not ready to receive. The years have been kind for with them have come wisdom, humility and a new perspective on life and calling. Now I understand the importance of character and the need to be Light &amp; Salt. With new found zeal I&rsquo;m pursuing my dreams using every talent and resource God has put at my disposal.</p>
      <p>In 2012 we will be opening the first Charter High School of Performing Arts in Jersey City, New Jersey: DREAM PAS. I&rsquo;m pastoring Kingdom of God Ministries: a small wonderful church in Jersey City. I&rsquo;ve teamed up with Ben Harney again, along with the amazing Daryl Richardson-choreographer, Charles Czarnecki - music Director, my good friend Stephen Glavin - president of VOX Solutions to produce Children of God the Musical.</p>
      <p><strong>&ldquo;A modern musical mashup of inspiration for the next generation.&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working with teenagers and many at risk young people for over <strong>20</strong> years. <strong><em>Children of God was birthed out of those experiences.</em></strong> Our story follows a week in the lives of three amazing teenagers highlighted in song and dance. <strong>DC</strong> is being raised by his stepfather, <strong>Tunica</strong> only has her grandmother and <strong>Will</strong> is in Foster Care. Each of them is significantly special and gifted, they each deserve a chance; all three are <strong>Children of God! Children of God</strong> is a story of hope that I believe needs to be told. <a href="http://www.childrenofgod.com">www.childrenofgod.com</a></p>
      <p>We&rsquo;re raising funds to open up off Broadway this July in New York City as part of the <strong>Midtown International Theater Festival</strong>. Our ultimate goal is to bring Children of God to the Broadway stage and film. The saying &ldquo;It takes a whole Village to raise a Child&rdquo; has significantly more meaning in this day and age. <strong><em>Children of God</em></strong> not only inspires our youth but challenges every adult to become involved in their development.</p>
      <p><em>Please help us. Visit our site or check us out on <strong>Rockethub</strong> to donate to the show or visit the Midtown International Theater Festival&rsquo;s site to buy tickets. My prayer is that someone in some way is inspired hearing my journey. Never give up! Never lose Hope!</em></p>
