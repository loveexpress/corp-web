            <h4>First Step</h4>
            <h4 class="qa">If You are a Substance Abuser or have any kind of Addiction Problem: Read This</h4>
            <div id="authorname">
              <p>by Author Don Wilkerson </p>
            </div>
      <p ><span class="qa">What you read here may prove<br />
      </span><span class="qa">to be very 
        helpful to you</span><br />
        <br />
        First, let me make this point: It does not matter to me if you&rsquo;re a casual drug user, weekend drinker or a habitual user. It&rsquo;s immaterial whether you have a big habit, little habit or no habit at all at this point. The fact that you are any kind of drug or alcohol user (or have another type of life-controlling problem) places you &ldquo;at-risk.&rdquo; Just look around at some of your friends that are &ldquo;users,&rdquo; maybe even addicts. They can tell you a lot about where you may be headed.</p>
      <p>At this point in your substance abuse, gambling, sexual or pornography addiction you may feel lucky not to be worse off. I prefer to call it the grace of God. You&rsquo;re living on borrowed time. Any day now may be payday and the wages can be frightening.</p>
      <p>Admit it: You have entered a world filled with dangerous minefields and your behavior can at any moment blow up in your face. If you minimize your habit, you will not maximize the opportunity to get help.</p>
      <p class="qa">If you minimize your habit, you will not maximize the opportunity to get help.</p>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re a frequent or even infrequent pot-smoker or a heavy drinker and rationalize your substance use by saying things like, &ldquo;Everyone gets high once in a while,&rdquo; you may rationalize yourself right into serious addiction.</p>
      <p>The challenge to you is this: Are your willing and ready to stop, and to stop forever? Until that decision is made, no book you read, no one trying to reach out and help you, not Scripture or prayer on your behalf is going to work. You have the power of choice. We make our choices and our choices turn around and make us, for better or worse.</p>
      <p>Dont&rsquo; take the risk of joining Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Bruce Lee, River Phoenix, Anna Nicole Smith, Amy Winehouse, Heath Ledger, Michael Jackson and thousands of others that passed on before their time. The list of famous and not-so-famous people who have died as the result of too much drugs or too much booze is long, very long. Don&rsquo;t add your name to that list.</p>
      <p>The addiction clock is ticking. Don&rsquo;t let it strike twelve, the &ldquo;lights out&rdquo; hour.</p>
      <p>What&rsquo;s your decision?</p>
      <p>I have known many a hardcore addict and alcoholic who would have given anything to have someone intervene in his or her situation as they were on the road to devastation, and stop them before they reached dead-end street. You may be at a point where your downward spiral can be stopped. There is an exit ramp off your broad road to destruction. You just need to know it and take it, once you see the sign. I am holding up the sign to you right now. Probably, others have, as well.</p>
      <p class="qa">There is an exit ramp off your broad road to destruction, and I am holding up its sign for your right now.</p>
      <p>You can be wise, or you can be a fool.</p>
      <p>Wise people stop and think! Fools ignore the warnings and go on.</p>
      <p><strong>&ldquo;Walk with the wise and become wise; associate with fools and get in trouble.&rdquo; </strong>(Proverbs 13:20)</p>
      <p>Where are you walking? And who are you walking with, the wise or the foolish?</p>
      <p>If you want to wise up, then read on.</p>
      <p><strong>The Top Ten List of Miseries from Substance Abuse, as described in the Bible in Proverbs 23-29-35</strong> <span class="articlecredits">(New Living Translation)</span></p>
      <p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who has anguish?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who has sorrow?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>3. &ldquo;Who is always fighting?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>4.&rdquo;Who is always complaining?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>5. &ldquo;Who has unnecessary bruises?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>6. &ldquo;Who has bloodshot eyes?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7.&rdquo;You will see hallucinations.&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>8. &ldquo;You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea.&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>9. And you will say, &ldquo;They hit me, but I didn&rsquo;t feel it. I didn&rsquo;t even know when they beat me up.&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>10. &ldquo;When will I wake up so I can look for another drink?&rdquo;</strong></p>
      <p>You may say, &ldquo;But those things haven&rsquo;t happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Good! You&rsquo;re fortunate. However, can you be sure that tomorrow one or more of the above descriptions of a life out of control will not happen to you? You may be in charge now, but you are taking in a substance that for millions it slowly, but surely demands a little more. And then it requires more frequent intake, and finally you are no longer in charge. <strong>You can become a prisoner to a pleasure that becomes a poison.</strong></p>
