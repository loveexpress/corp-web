              <p>It&rsquo;s the  New Year, and you may be super motivated to lose weight. You have undoubtedly  been bombar&shy;ded with advertisements for the latest diets - you know, the ones  that promise to help you lose 10 pounds in a week, or slim down without any  effort. Before you turn over your hard earned dollars to buy that new book or program, read on to learn the pros and cons  about some of the most popular programs and how to choose a healthy and safe  food plan, and NOT a &lsquo;diet&rsquo;.</p>
              <p>A lot of the diets on the market are  based on pseudoscience - theories and me&shy;thods  that are not based on scientific facts. They blend a little legitimate science  with a lot of fiction to make the theories appear logical. People may lose  weight on these diets, but it is mostly due to the elimination of major food  groups, like carbohydrates. This leads to a reduction in calories, which is the  real reason for the weight loss.&nbsp; Here  are a few that I feel fall into this category:</p>
              <p> <strong>The  Blood Type Diet.</strong> This diet states that you should eat according to your  blood type for maximum energy and health. The author proposes that blood types  were developed at different times during human evolution, and thus we ate  differently during these periods. For example, Blood Group O was the first  blood type of our ancestors who were hunters-gatherers around 50,000 B.C.  Because they subsisted on a high animal protein diet, people who have this  blood type should do the same, and not eat any dairy or wheat or grain  products. There is no valid science behind this theory.&nbsp; Your blood type has nothing to do with what  you eat. </p>
              <p> <strong>The  Paleo Diet.</strong> Also known as the Caveman diet, the underlying belief is that  if we ate like our ancestors did thousands of years ago, we would be healthier,  lose weight and curb disease. The general  diet focuses on meat and fish, as well as shellfish, poultry, eggs, veggies,  root, fruits and berries, while excluding dairy, legumes, su&shy;gar and salt. In  other words, if the cavemen didn&rsquo;t eat it, you shouldn&rsquo;t either. This may sound  like a great diet as it limits salt and sugar intake, while promoting fruit and  vegetable intake, but eli&shy;minating whole grains, le&shy;gu&shy;mes and dairy is risky  as they are great sources of fi&shy;ber, vitamins and minerals. Moreover, high  protein diets can be high in cholesterol. </p>
              <p> <strong>Acid-Alkaline Diet.</strong> This principle  behind this diet is that certain foods promote acid more than others, which  would in turn can lead to decreased bone health, heart health, and higher risk  of dia&shy;betes and cancer. In actuality, the  body is very efficient at maintaining a constant pH regardless of what  we eat. Again, there is no evidenced based science supporting this approach. </p>
              <p> <strong>The  Fast Diet.</strong> This diet instructs you to eat normally 5 times a week and fast  the other 2 days - you are limited to 500 calories (female) or 600 calories  (male). This is dangerous because your bo&shy;dy will interpret the extreme decrease  in calories as starvation. It will deplete your ve&shy;ry necessary glucose stores  and begin to breakdown lean body mass. Of course you lose weight, but it is not  sustainable nor is it a healthy approach to weight and health management. </p>
              <p>I can continue because there are so many  unsound diets out there, but I hope you get the point. Diets are not ideal  because they are short-term &ndash; they don&rsquo;t last long because you can&rsquo;t stick to  it. A food plan is a structure for eating each day that can last a lifetime. So  how do you choose a safe and healthy food plan? </p>
              <p>First, no plan  should provide less than approximately 1200 calories (unless  your 4&rsquo;11). Anything below that will launch  you into starvation/ deprivation mode. Try to eat less than this for a few days  and you&rsquo;ll eat the paint off the wall because you&rsquo;re so hungry. Second, a  healthy food plan will include all the food groups - including carbohydrates. You need the nutrients from these  foods to support good health. The food plan  will emphasize portion control - there is no way around it, you have to  eat less to weigh less. Most importantly, it must feature flexibility and  adaptability to one&rsquo;s lifestyle. You want a food plan you can see yourself maintaining a year or two from now, not  just for the next few weeks. A healthy food plan will foster gradual lifestyle  changes that you&rsquo;ll feel good about, which  will increase your ability to sustain them. </p>
              <p>Here are some of my favo&shy;rite food plans  that meet these criteria:</p>
              <p><strong>Dietary Approaches to Stop </strong><strong>Hypertension (DASH) Diet. </strong>Based on studies sponsored by  the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), it emphasizes vegetables,  fruits and fat-free or low-fat dairy, and includes whole grains, fish, poultry, legu&shy;mes, and  vegetable oils, while limiting sodium, added sugars,  and red meats. It has been proven to lower high blood pressure, improve  lipid profile, and reduce risk of developing cardiovascular disea- ses. </p>
              <p><strong>Therapeutic  Lifestyle Changes (TLC) Diet.</strong> TLC was developed by the  Natio&shy;nal Institutes of Health (NIH) and endorsed by the American Heart  Association to help decrease cholesterol. It includes diet, physical activity,  weight loss, and smoking cessation. This food plan aims to limit the amount of  saturated fat you eat by reducing (not eliminating) the amount of meat and  whole dairy products consumed. </p>
              <p> <strong>Mayo  Clinic Diet.</strong> This diet incorporates  physical activity, portion control, and menu planning, while encou&shy;raging  unlimited amounts of vegetables and fruit. It provides the tools to lose weight  gradually and permanantly without eliminating any food group! The focus is on  low-calorie, nutrient dense foods that include whole-grains, lean protein,  fish, low-fat dairy and heart-healthy unsaturated fats. </p>
              <p>You can see the healthy thread running  through these food plans. Now, not all diets are right for everyone. I  encourage you to check these out and make the  right choice for you. If you have a medi&shy;cal condition or specific concern, consult  with a Registered Die&shy;titian to assist you in developing a plan just for you. </p>
