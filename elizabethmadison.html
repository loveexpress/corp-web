              <p>You only  have one heart. You have two lungs, two kidneys, and even a regenerative liver,  but only one heart. Though it is the most important organ in the body, we tend  to take it for granted until it stops working the way it should. Chest pain, or  worse, a heart attack,&nbsp; soon follow.  Thus, keeping your heart in top shape should be your highest priority. Even if  you haven&rsquo;t taken the best care of your heart up to now, this is a great time  to start, American Heart Month. Here are 6 tips to start you on your way to a  healthy heart. </p>
              
              <p><strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong> Excess  weight is a major contributor to heart disease, especially around the abdomen.  Extra fat around the abdomen is not only dangerous for your heart, but other  organs as well. A man&rsquo;s risk of heart disease is increased if his waist  measures greater than 40 inches (35 inches for women). In general, the higher  the scale goes the greater risk you have. You don&rsquo;t have to lose a lot of  weight &ndash; just losing 5%-10% of your weight will improve your cholesterol level,  lower your blood pressure and help maintain normal blood glucose levels,  thereby decreasing your risk of heart disease. So if you weigh 250 pounds, just  25 pounds will make your heart healthier! </p>
              
              <p><strong>Up your intake of healthy foods.</strong> Red meat  (which can be high in saturated fat and cholesterol), added sugars, and excess  salt can all lead to heart disease. Some saturated fat is okay (around 7% of  your daily overall food intake), but too much can contribute to plaque buildup  in arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis. Left untreated, this plaque  can clog arteries, impairing blood flow, which can&nbsp; cause a heart attack. Excess sugars and salt  are other culprits of heart disease. Try to go vegetarian for two days per week  &ndash; don&rsquo;t eat anything with a mother or a face. Choose foods that have less than  9 grams of sugar per serving, and aim to limit your salt intake to no more than  2300mg or about 1 teaspoon of salt per day.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Your heart will love you for it!&nbsp;  And of course, increase your intake of fruits, veggies, legumes, and  whole grains for a boost in vitamins, minerals, and fiber! Fiber not only fills  your tummy, but studies have shown that fibrous foods (fruits, veggies, whole  grains, legumes) aids in the prevention of heart disease and several types of cancers!  On average, women need 25g fiber per day and men need 38g fiber per day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              
              <p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Sitting  is the new smoking. A sedentary lifestyle increases risk of cardiovascular  disease. If you are spending too much time in front of the screen (TV, computer,  tablets, phones), or sitting more than you stand, you are at risk for heart  disease. Contrary to what fad diets promote, you really need to work out 45-60  minutes of moderate intensity exercise most days of the week. What counts as  moderate intensity, you ask? If you can sing easily as you work out, you&rsquo;re not  working hard enough. Remember, exercising doesn&rsquo;t only mean getting a  membership at your local gym. From running, dancing, to gardening, find out  what works best for you and just keep moving! Purchase an App or fitness device  like FitBit to track your movement. They are really effective because they keep  you focused. </p>
              
              <p><strong>Downgrade your stress level.</strong> All the  healthy eating and exercising in the world won&rsquo;t matter if you live in a  constant state of stress. Although the exact connection between chronic stress  and heart disease is not clear, chronic stress can affect physical health.&nbsp; Stress stimulates hormones in your body to  prepare for the &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; response, which can override normal body cues,  such as hunger, satiety, and digestion. Chronic stress can weaken your immune  system, making you more susceptible to fatigue and disease. It can lead to  unhealthy lifestyle choices&nbsp; -  overeating, mindless eating, meal skipping, drinking, and smoking. Some healthy  ways to decrease your stress and anxiety levels include social support from  loved ones, praying (a lot!), journaling, breathing exercises, meditating,  and&nbsp; physical activity. If you feel like  you are going at a constant 70mph, take a deep breath, slow down and de-stress.  Do this daily!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              
              <p><strong>Keep your doctor&rsquo;s appointment.</strong> Schedule  a yearly check-up and a physical. You need to know your numbers &ndash; cholesterol,  triglycerides, blood glucose (fasting and A1c) and blood pressure. Even vitamin  D. Don&rsquo;t wait; ignorance is not bliss. And don&rsquo;t tell yourself that you &lsquo;just  won&rsquo;t claim it&rsquo;. I see too many patients that waited too long to address  medical issues or &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t claim it&rsquo;, and are now suffering the  consequences.&nbsp; Know your medical status  and get working on it now to improve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
              
              <p><strong>Seek God&rsquo;s help.</strong> It can  be hard&nbsp; to make positive, lasting  changes. We can have the willingness but not the follow-through. This is where  your God steps in, if you seek Him. Pray first for His will for your health,  then set your goals. Pray daily for strength, patience and perseverance. If you  believe that God can make you successful, you will be. As it says in Isaiah  40:29, He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. I  wish you much success and heart health! </p>
