            <h4 id="articleTitle">Slow Down Pastors</h4>
              <div id="authorname">by Dimas Salaberrios

              <p>The  demands on New York City Pastors are relentless. Manhattan is the most  influential island in the world and in every survey the first or second most  influential city (only second to London at times) in the world. What happens in  NYC goes into hyper-drive through other  cities. The surrounding boroughs supply the fuel for Manhattan to operate at  its high capacity and its contribution cannot be underestimated. The pressures  of this city affect the residents of New York and causes NYC Pastors to face  challenges that are unique to this city.</p>
              <p>As a pastor you have to be well read,  articulate, have high organizational skills and be a successful fundraiser. One  Pastor asked me to name one successful church in the city were the pastor was  not an exceptional fund&shy;raiser. I thought about it and I could not find one.  However, most seminaries do not train on the subject. To say the least New York  City ministry is extremely tough on a pastor and his home life.</p>
              <p> <strong>Concerts  of Prayer is screaming from its pulpit to &ldquo;Slow down pastor and recognize that  there are others just like you.</strong> Be smart pastor and recognize that your  situation is not out of ordinary and most other Senior Elders are facing or  have faced the struggles you currently experience.&rdquo; I remember one busy pastor  said to me at the last Pastors' Prayer Summit, &ldquo;I am too busy to stay,&rdquo; but  then after being there for 6 hours regretted not blocking out the time. He  said, &quot;I need this for my soul.&quot; There is no&shy;thing like spending 48  hours praying and fellowshipping with leaders that go through the exact same  struggles that you face. There is no denominational  agenda being presented and you always have an option to hear a presenter or  plug in to our 24hr worship and prayer room facilitated by top worship and prayer leaders from chur&shy;ches through-out the  tri-state area. </p>
              <p>Several pastors fall for Satan's old  trick which tells us that our ministry is so uni&shy;que and it will collapse if we  do not stay on the job January 19th through the 21st. The other trick is to  tell you that you are so awesome that you  do not need to go unless you are the presenter. Lastly, some may feel like I&rsquo;ve  been there and done that. However, if a member of their church practiced that  same philosophy on church attendance saying, &quot;<em>Pastor I do not need the fellowship anymore I will just watch you or  another talented speaker via online or television,&rdquo;</em> they would sing a  different tune. <strong>Pastors' we need to slow  down annually not with outer town people but with each other to uniquely speak  and pray for the city in which we labor in.</strong></p>
              <p>We have a blend of presenters but this  is not a presentation driven conference, to qualify the presenter must be an  example of 1 Timothy 3, <em>&ldquo;Qualifications  of Overseers: This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a  bishop,[a] he desires a good work. A bi&shy;shop then must be blameless, the  husband of one wife, temperate, sober-min&shy;ded, of good behavior, hospitable,  able to teach; not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money,[b] but gentle, not quarrelsome, not co&shy;ve&shy;tous;  one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all  reverence (for if a man does not know how to  rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); not a  novice, lest be&shy;ing puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as  the devil. Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the  snare of the devil.&rdquo;</em></p>
              <p>Our speakers have believing kids, strong  churches and are seasoned leaders with solid reputations. These men qualify as  spiritual fathers who have run a good race and  have an abundance to pour out to us all. However, we do not operate from  a top down approach but from a fellow  elder perspective.</p>
              <p>This year, after 23 years at the same  location, we are switching it up and moving to Connecticut. We look forward to exploring the new facilities and continue to create strong relationships  with our peers. You will be able to enjoy the conference and meals together, as  well as, some down time in the pool, gym, sauna or just meditating while  looking out over the beautiful landscapes on the grounds.</p>
              <p> <strong>So,  slow down Pastor and come fellowship with your  co-laborers in Greater New York.</strong></p>
