              <p ><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>The Love Express</strong> sat down with <strong>Bishop Frank Anthone White</strong> to go behind the veil of his booming prayer  movement which, now in its 19th year, continues  to draw crowds of all ages from nearly every mainstream Protestant de&shy;nomination.  According to Bishop White, during the Crusade Schedule of FAW Evangelistic  Ministries in the Spring of 1992 &ldquo;the formation  of this bold, vigorous adventure into the holy pre&shy;cincts of prayer  basically grew out of a three component process reinforced by the biblically  defined ne&shy;ces&shy;sity of prayer &ndash; not as an event&ndash; but as a lifestyle:<em>the application component,</em> the <em>clinical component</em> and the <em>fellowship component.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Though we are commissioned by Scripture  to &lsquo;pray without ceasing&rsquo;, in reality, the  daily hustling and</p>
              <p>accelerated  rush-hour pace of today&rsquo;s working population leaves us scarcely able to find  the time to pray as we would like&rdquo; Bishop  White explains. The current cultural paradigm calls for an or&shy;ganized setting for believers to connect with the  power of God through corporate pra&shy;yer. In responding to this growing  reality, the Conference has provided an op&shy;portunity for attendees to submit their personal pra&shy;yer requests in  writing and, through relevant seminars, share their personal experiences with  the ultimate goal of expressing their gratitude  over answered pra&shy;yers through worship. This is what builds a climate of participation and <em>application</em>, positioning the believer to achieve contact with the  shared strength and spiritual sincerity of those who are willing to literally  &ldquo;stand in the gap&rdquo; on their behalf.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <em>clinical  component</em> of the FAW Prayer Partnership was built around an eight-week  Prayer Clinic during Fall of 1996. Comprised, in part, of participants from a 6  AM Prayer Ministry which ran for six consecutive months earlier the same year,  the clinic welcomed an influx of ea&shy;ger learners  wishing to streng&shy;then their perspective on the ministry of prayer. &ldquo;It was  amazing! As expected, many of the members of Zion Cathedral pressed their way  to the early morning prayer. But what stood out was how a significant cluster  of the surrounding neighbors would find themselves hurrying down the side  streets of Babylon Turnpike just before sunrise to arrive at the sanctuary and  kneel before God in prayer &ndash; five days a week, without fail.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with establishing a framework for  the fundamentals of prayer, the pra&shy;yer clinic covered topics in&shy;cluding:the  mandate of pra&shy;yer, the levels of prayer, the urgency of prayer, the  consistency of prayer, the purpose and spiritual mechanisms of intercession and  the discipline of prayer as accessorized by fasting. Though totally unplanned,  from this clinic, a flourishing pool of prayer  warriors grew into an organized de&shy;le&shy;ga&shy;tion known today as FAW  Evangelistic Crusade Mini&shy;stries Prayer Partners. This partnership has become a  family of familiar faces throughout the year at Zion Cathedral of Freeport where Bishop White pastors alongside his  father, Bishop Frank Otha White, both serving as re-elected officers of the Church of God in Christ&rsquo;s  International Body. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is  nothing re&shy;vo&shy;lutio&shy;nary about the global call to pray&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;In fact,  the most sweeping revival of Pentecostalism of the previous century owes its  impact to the foundation of prayer. It was at during the Azusa Street Revivals  of Los Angeles, California from 1906-1909 that the Founder of the Church of God  in Christ, Bishop Charles Harrison Mason, re&shy;ceived  the baptism of the Holy Ghost in a cotton gin house  prayer meeting. From this same historic revival, emerged the brotherhood of Pentecostal As&shy;semblies which yet  flourish upon this very same foundational practice of unceasing pra&shy;yer.&rdquo;</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the years have ad&shy;vanced, <em>the  fellowship com</em><em>ponent</em> of  the Prayer Confe&shy;rence has featured a five-star breakfast not unlike a weekend  buffet at Marriott International. While attendees dine from a gourmet menu  colorfully displayed across hot and cold  stations stocked with unlimited breakfast amenities in Zion&rsquo;s Lower  Fellowship, prayer warriors assemble in the upper sanctuary in in&shy;crements of  between 250-300 from each of the three seatings, perfuming the worship  atmosphere with the fragrance of prayer.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having become a widely observed Long  Island tradition, the Prayer Conference has&ndash;and continues to attract &ndash; more  than 3,000 prayer warriors from across the Tri-State area annually. It&rsquo;s a special gathering, filled with  profound testimonies of healing and deliverance, the reunion of long-lasting  friendships and genuine prayer partnerships. Bishop White concludes, &ldquo;The more you cultivate your prayer life, the less  likely it be&shy;comes that you will not be inspired by the words of Lord Alfred  Tennyson who expressed &ndash; &lsquo;More things are wrought by prayer than this world  dreams of.&rsquo;</p>
