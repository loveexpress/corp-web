              <div id="authorname">Bert &amp; Alice Bocachica<!--SECTION LEFT END--></div>
              
              <p>Last August, during Rap Fest 2014, as some ar&shy;tists were  gracing the stage and others were hitting the vendor areas skillfully securing  their next feature, cy&shy;pher,  sponsorship, gig or tour, the Lord  impressed a powerful Word upon my wife and I and our hearts were heavy.</p>
              <p> Rap Fest was  created with the purpose of evangelizing local neighborhoods by delivering  God's Word, the Gospel of hope and salvation, using hip hop as the tool and  format of choice.</p>
              <p> This local  outreach has made a powerful impact in the lives of many people for years and  gained international recognition, which can only be attributed to God's grace  and favor. Noted for introducing some artists to the masses, quoted in  nationally published books, the inspiration behind the creation of many other  events and outreach efforts worldwide, Rap Fest has definitely covered a lot of  ground. However, after 21 years of this outreach ministry, Rap Fest 2014 can  now be dubbed as the very last one. Yes, you read that correctly. Our vision,  heart, passion and mission for evangelism has recently gained momentum but this avenue by which we have been doing it for so many years has now faded away.</p>
              <p> You may be  asking yourself, &quot;Why?&quot; All we can  say is the following: The Rap Fest &quot;stage&quot; became more of a platform  for artists' career advancement and bio highlights than a platform for reaching  the community. We will work prayerfully and arduously to maintain the integrity  of what we do at all times and we feel this decision is no different.</p>
              <p> We are not  disconnecting ourselves from everything and everyone. We still make ourselves  available and are willing to help any artist with their ministry and music. We  will continue to consult artists accordingly, leaning heavily on the knowledge,  experience, connections and credibility that we have attained over the years.  Our years of the Rap Fest ministry will not go to waste but we must remain  obedient with the call God placed  in our hearts back in 1994. Methods may change  and upgrades may be applied based on current trends and technology, but the  initial call and purpose will always be...the call and purpose. We vow to stick  to that.</p>
              <p> We thank God  for all of those ministries that sincere&shy;ly have a passion for evangelism and  have shared their talents and gifts with us. We pray that God will continue  using you in that field. We thank all of the countless vendors and sponsors  that have showed us love through the years. We also pray for the artists who  have shifted the majority of their efforts to &quot;trying to get a deal&quot;  or &quot;do this full time&quot;. May His will be done.</p>
              <p> In closing,  please continue to keep Alice Ramos Bocachica and I in your pra&shy;yers. We are  still heavily involved in outreach locally at our church, The Sanctuary  Fellowship, and we will also be helping other outreach mi&shy;nistries locally and  overseas. These are doors that God is opening for us and we are humbled by the  opportunities. Oh, and I will still drop 16 Bars when I have to. It's part of  who I am.</p>
              <p>Thanks and God Bless You,</p>
              <p align="right"><strong>Bert and Alice Bocachica</strong></p>
